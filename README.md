# Memory Keeper

**Claude Code forgets everything when a session ends.** What decisions you made yesterday, what bugs you fixed, how your project is structured - you have to explain it all over again every new session.

Memory Keeper solves this. **It automatically saves session content and loads it in the next session.**

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ZipperBagCoffee/memory-keeper-plugin
/plugin install memory-keeper
```

After installation, **you don't need to do anything**. It works automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Session start** - Loads saved content from previous sessions into Claude's context
2. **During work** - Auto-save triggers every 15 tool uses (configurable), Claude records decisions/patterns/issues directly
3. **Session end** - Full conversation backup + final save

## What Gets Saved

### Automatic (No action needed)
- `memory.md` - Session summaries accumulate here (auto-rotates at 23,750 tokens)
- `memory_*.md` - Rotated archives (L2)
- `*.summary.json` - L3 summaries (Haiku-generated)
- `sessions/*.l1.jsonl` - Detailed session transcripts (L1)

### Manual Setup (Optional)
If there's information you want Claude to know every session, **directly edit the files**:

```bash
# Create/edit files in your project's .claude/memory/ folder
echo "React + TypeScript web app." > .claude/memory/project.md
echo "src/ - components, hooks, services" > .claude/memory/architecture.md
echo "Functional components only" > .claude/memory/conventions.md
```

Or just ask Claude: "Save the project info to project.md"

With this setup, **Claude starts every new session knowing this information**.

## Slash Commands

**Works in any project where the plugin is installed:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/memory-keeper:save-memory` | Save now (don't wait for auto-save) |
| `/memory-keeper:load-memory` | Reload memory (after manual edits) |
| `/memory-keeper:search-memory query` | Search past sessions |
| `/memory-keeper:clear-memory old` | Clean up files older than 30 days |
| `/memory-keeper:discussing "topic"` | Create/update a discussion document |
| `/memory-keeper:planning "topic"` | Create/update a plan document |
| `/memory-keeper:ticketing P001 "topic"` | Create/update a ticket tied to a plan |
| `/memory-keeper:researching "topic"` | Create/update a research document |
| `/memory-keeper:workflow` | Run the 11-phase agent orchestration workflow |
| `/memory-keeper:lessons` | Check/create project-specific lessons |

## Document Management (4-Skill System)

Track project work through structured, append-only documents:

| Skill | ID Format | Statuses | Use For |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| `/discussing` | D001 | open, concluded | Decisions, dialogues, conclusions |
| `/planning` | P001 | draft, approved, in-progress, done | Implementation plans with steps |
| `/ticketing` | P001_T001 | todo, in-progress, done, verified | Session-sized work units tied to plans |
| `/researching` | R001 | open, concluded | Investigations, analysis, findings |

Each document type has its own folder under `docs/` with an `INDEX.md` for status tracking. Tickets inherit from plans and require verification-at-creation (TDD principle).

## Agent Orchestration Workflow

For complex tasks, the workflow skill runs an 11-phase process with 3-layer architecture:

```
Work Agent     →  Analysis, planning, implementation
Review Agent   →  Verify, cite evidence, PASS/FAIL
Orchestrator   →  Intent guardian, meta-review, final authority
```

Key features:
- **Intent Anchor** - Non-negotiable requirements defined in Phase 1, enforced at every gate
- **Cross-Review** - When 2+ reviewers run in parallel, adversarial cross-examination is mandatory
- **Runtime Verification** - Mandatory runtime verification in Phase 8/9/10 (not just static checks)
- **1 Ticket = 1 Workflow** - Each ticket gets its own independent workflow execution

## CLAUDE.md Integration

The plugin automatically manages a rules section in your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## CRITICAL RULES (Core Principles Alignment)
...plugin-managed rules...
---Add your project-specific rules below this line---

## Your Project Rules (plugin never touches this)
Build pipeline: src → build → dist
Coding conventions: ...
```

- **Above the line**: Auto-managed by the plugin (updated on every session start)
- **Below the line**: Your project-specific content (never modified by the plugin)

> **Note:** The plugin also writes a warning to Claude Code's built-in `MEMORY.md` (at `~/.claude/projects/{project}/memory/MEMORY.md`) to prevent confusion between the two memory systems. This is separate from the plugin's own `memory.md`.

## Configuration

`~/.claude/memory-keeper/config.json`:
```json
{
  "saveInterval": 15,
  "keepRaw": false,
  "rulesInjectionFrequency": 1
}
```
- `saveInterval`: How many tool uses before auto-save (default: 15)
- `keepRaw`: Keep raw.jsonl files after L1 conversion (default: false)
- `rulesInjectionFrequency`: Inject rules every N prompts (default: 1 = every prompt)

## Hierarchical Memory Architecture

```
L1 (sessions/*.l1.jsonl)  - Refined session transcripts (~95% size reduction)
     ↓
L2 (memory_*.md)          - Rotated archives (auto at 23,750 tokens)
     ↓
L3 (*.summary.json)       - Haiku-generated summaries
     ↓
memory.md                 - Active rolling memory (loaded at startup)
```

- **L1**: Raw transcripts refined to keep only meaningful content
- **L2**: memory.md auto-rotates when too large, archives preserved
- **L3**: AI-generated summaries of archived content
- **Search**: `search-memory` traverses L3 → L2 → memory.md (add `--deep` for L1)
