# Investigation Document Skill

## Modes

- **Create mode:** `/investigating "title"` — creates a new investigation document
- **Update mode:** `/investigating I001` — appends findings to an existing investigation

---

## Create Mode

When argument is a title string (not an I-prefixed ID):

### Step 1: Ensure folder exists

Check if `docs/investigation/` exists.

- **Folder does not exist:** Create it and create `docs/investigation/INDEX.md` with content below.
- **Folder exists but INDEX.md does NOT exist:** Pre-existing files detected. Create `docs/investigation/backup/`, move ALL existing files into it, then create INDEX.md. Report to user: "Moved N existing files to docs/investigation/backup/"
- **Folder exists and INDEX.md exists:** Already managed. Proceed.

INDEX.md content:
```
# Investigation Index

| ID | Title | Status | Created | Related |
|----|-------|--------|---------|---------|
```

### Step 2: Determine next ID

Glob `docs/investigation/I*.md`.
Extract numeric part. Next ID = max + 1, zero-padded to 3 digits.
If no files exist, start at 001.

### Step 3: Gather investigation parameters

Ask the user:
1. **Topic:** What is being investigated? Why?
2. **Questions:** What specific questions need answers?
3. **Sources:** Any specific sources to include? (URLs, files, codebases)

### Step 4: Create investigation document

Create `docs/investigation/I{NNN}-{slug}.md`:

```
# I{NNN} - {title}

## Topic
{what is being investigated and why}

## Questions
1. {question 1}
2. {question 2}
...

## Sources
- Internet: {URLs searched/found}
- Local: {files/code examined}
- User-specified: {if any}

## Investigation Log

### Agent 1: {focus area}
{findings}

### Agent 2: {focus area}
{findings}

## Cross-Review
{Review Agents challenge each other's findings}

## Synthesis (Orchestrator)
{integrated conclusions from all agents}

## Conclusions
- Key findings: ...
- Confidence level: ...
- Gaps/unknowns: ...

## Log

---
### [{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}] Investigation started
{methodology, initial sources, approach}
```

### Step 5: Execute multi-agent investigation

Launch parallel Work Agents, each assigned a different focus area or source type:

- **Work Agent 1:** Internet research (WebSearch/WebFetch) — search for relevant information online
- **Work Agent 2:** Local investigation — examine local files, code, configurations
- **Work Agent N:** Additional agents as needed for user-specified sources or distinct angles

Each Work Agent appends findings to their designated section in the I document.

### Step 6: Cross-review

Launch Review Agents (paired with Work Agents per CLAUDE.md rules):

- Each Review Agent reviews findings from a different Work Agent
- Review Agents challenge each other's conclusions, identify contradictions and blind spots
- Cross-Review section is populated with contested findings, consensus, and blind spots

### Step 7: Orchestrator synthesis

The Orchestrator:
1. Reads all agent findings and the cross-review
2. Synthesizes integrated conclusions
3. Populates the Synthesis and Conclusions sections
4. Assesses confidence level and identifies gaps

### Step 8: Update INDEX.md

Append row to `docs/investigation/INDEX.md`:

```
| I{NNN} | {title} | open | {YYYY-MM-DD} | |
```

### Step 9: Confirm

Tell user: "Created I{NNN}. Investigation complete. See Conclusions for findings summary."

## Update Mode

When argument matches `I\d{3}` pattern:

### Step 1: Read existing document

Glob `docs/investigation/I{NNN}-*.md`. If not found, stop.

### Step 2: Append log entry

Append to end of document:

```

---
### [{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}] {entry_type}
{content}
```

Entry types:
- `New findings` — additional findings, data, analysis results
- `Conclusion update` — revised conclusions with new evidence
- `Status change: {old} → {new}`

### Step 3: Re-run investigation if needed

If new findings warrant it, re-run the multi-agent investigation (Steps 5-7 from Create Mode) with updated focus areas. Append new agent findings, cross-review, and synthesis to the document.

### Step 4: Update INDEX.md if status changed

Update status column in `docs/investigation/INDEX.md`.

### Status Transitions

- `open` → `concluded` (all questions answered)
- `open` → `abandoned` (no longer relevant)

## Rules

1. **NEVER modify existing content.** Only append to Log section and update Conclusions/Synthesis during investigation.
2. **Conclusion section** must answer each Question from the Questions section individually, with evidence and confidence assessment.
3. **INDEX.md** is the only file where existing content may be modified (status updates).
4. When investigation leads to a discussion or plan, note in log: "→ See D{NNN}" or "→ See P{NNN}" and update INDEX.md Related column.
5. **Multi-agent is mandatory for Create mode.** At minimum 2 Work Agents with different focus areas. Single-agent investigation defeats the purpose.
6. **Cross-review is mandatory.** Review Agents must challenge findings before Orchestrator synthesis. No synthesis without cross-review.
7. **Source diversity.** Investigation must use at least 2 different source types (internet + local, internet + user-specified, etc.) unless the topic explicitly restricts sources.
8. **Mandatory work log:** After performing any work related to this document, append a log entry to the Log section using the existing format (`### [{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}] {entry_type}`). This applies regardless of whether this skill was explicitly invoked — if the work touched or advanced this investigation's purpose, log it.
9. **I documents are independent.** They do not participate in D → P → T hierarchy or status cascades. They may be referenced by other documents but have no parent/child relationships.
