# Agent Orchestration Workflow

> Principles (Understanding-First, HHH, Critical Stance, etc.) are injected via RULES every prompt.
> This document defines HOW those principles apply to agent-based task execution.

## Core Concepts

**Understanding = Closing gaps + Inferring consequences.**
Understanding without inference is just parroting. You must go beyond what is stated.
**Proof of understanding is not action — it is not acting without understanding.**

### The Feedback Loop

Your inference may reveal problems with the original intent itself:

```
Close gap → Infer → Detect problems in intent → Report/Question → User clarifies → Close gap again
```

When this happens: report what you found, ask clarifying questions, close the new gap before proceeding.

### Gap Types

| Gap Type | Where | Symptom |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Requirements | User intent vs your understanding | Wrong direction |
| Analysis | Actual code vs your understanding | Wrong assumptions |
| Plan | Intended vs planned changes | Missing/unnecessary work |
| Implementation | Plan vs actual code | Result doesn't match plan |
| Agent | Your intent vs agent's understanding | Wrong agent results |
| Intent | What user said vs what user needs | Correct execution of wrong goal |
| Review | What was checked vs what should be | False "PASS" verdict |

## 3-Layer Architecture

```
Work Agent:     Analysis, planning, implementation (heavy work)
Review Agent:   Review, verify (quality check — fresh context, no attachment)
Orchestrator:   Intent guardian, meta-review, meta-verify, report (final authority)
```

Every stage: **Work Agent → Review Agent → Orchestrator (Intent Guardian)**

**The Orchestrator is the Intent Guardian.** It judges whether review feedback serves or undermines the original intent. Reviewer opinions that would dilute, distort, or drift from the user's actual goal are overridden.

### Why 3 Layers (not 2)

| 2-Layer Problem | 3-Layer Fix |
|----------------|-------------|
| Orchestrator verifies by grep/text search | Review Agent does deep structural comparison |
| Orchestrator has completion bias after long session | Review Agent has fresh context |
| Orchestrator checks "exists?" not "matches?" | Review Agent's ONLY job is comparison |
| Orchestrator writes lessons then violates them | Meta-verify catches what reviewer missed |

### What Each Role Needs

| Role | Mindset |
|------|---------|
| **Orchestrator** | Close understanding gap before delegating. Filter reviews through original intent. Spot-check claims (scaled to reviewer count). Run cross-review when 2+ reviewers. Never aggregate — judge. **Verify runtime verification results exist and are valid — final gatekeeper.** |
| **Work Agent** | Execute exactly what's specified. If reality differs from plan, STOP and report. No improvisation. **After implementation, perform runtime verification to prove code is reachable.** |
| **Review Agent** | Cite specific evidence. Predict behavior, don't just check text existence. PASS/FAIL only. Fresh context, no attachment to the work. **Independently perform runtime verification — never trust Work Agent's results.** |

## 11-Phase Workflow

```
Phase 1:   Understand          → Orchestrator + User
Phase 2:   Analyze             → Work Agent
Phase 3:   Review Analysis     → Review Agent(s)
Phase 3.5: Cross-Review        → Review Agents (BLOCKING, if 2+ reviewers)
Phase 4:   Meta-Review         → Orchestrator (Intent Guardian)

Phase 5:   Plan                → Work Agent
Phase 6:   Review Plan         → Review Agent(s)
Phase 6.5: Cross-Review        → Review Agents (BLOCKING, if 2+ reviewers)
Phase 7:   Meta-Review Plan    → Orchestrator + User
Phase 7.5: Alternative         → Orchestrator (optional)

Phase 8:   Implement           → Work Agent
Phase 9:   Verify              → Review Agent(s)
Phase 9.5: Cross-Review        → Review Agents (BLOCKING, if 2+ reviewers)
Phase 10:  Meta-Verify         → Orchestrator (Intent Guardian)

Phase 11:  Report              → Orchestrator
```

### Agent Prompt Template (generic)

All agent prompts follow this structure:

```
## Background
[Why this is needed — Phase 1 understanding + relevant prior phase outputs]

## Intent Anchor (DO NOT violate)
IA-1: [requirement]
IA-2: [requirement]
...

## Task
[WORK or REVIEW — never both in one prompt]
[Specific instructions for this phase]

## Reference (if applicable)
[What to compare against]

## Expected Output
[Format and verdict structure]

## Confirmation
State your understanding before working.
```

### Phase 1: Understand (Orchestrator + User)

**YOUR job — never delegate.**

1. State understanding explicitly: current state, desired state, must preserve, constraints
2. Infer implicit requirements — what would a reasonable person expect even if not mentioned?
3. Produce **Intent Anchor** — numbered list of non-negotiable requirements (3-7 items):
   ```
   IA-1: [requirement]
   IA-2: [requirement]
   ...
   ```
   These are the things that CANNOT be violated. Every meta-review gate re-reads this list.
4. Confirm with user: "Is this understanding correct? Are these the right Intent Anchor items?"
5. User corrects → gap found → adjust Intent Anchor → confirm again

### Phase 2: Analyze (Work Agent)

Trace call chains, dependencies, state changes, user-visible behavior.

**When NOT to use agents:** simple grep, checking text existence, reading a single short file.

### Phase 3: Review Analysis (Review Agent)

- Check completeness (all files/functions covered?)
- Check accuracy (read code yourself, verify claims)
- Per-item verdict: Claim → Verified YES/NO/PARTIALLY → Issue
- Overall: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE (with specific gaps)

### Phase 3.5 / 6.5 / 9.5: Cross-Review (BLOCKING Gate)

**Triggers when 2+ Review Agents ran in parallel.** The next Meta-Review phase CANNOT begin without this step. Single reviewer → skip to Meta-Review.

**Procedure:**

1. Orchestrator collects all review results
2. Each reviewer receives the OTHER reviewers' findings with instructions:
   - **Challenge**: conclusions you disagree with — explain why
   - **Contradict**: findings that conflict with yours — cite evidence
   - **Blind spots**: what did they miss that you caught, and vice versa?
3. Each reviewer produces a Cross-Review Response
4. Orchestrator synthesizes into a **Cross-Review Report** (required input for Meta-Review)

**Cross-Review Report format:**

```
## Cross-Review Report
| Finding | R1 | R2 | R3 | Conflict? |
|---------|----|----|-----|-----------|
| [item]  | [position + evidence] | [agrees/disagrees + why] | ... | YES/NO |

## Contested Findings
[Items where reviewers disagree — orchestrator MUST resolve in Meta-Review]

## Blind Spots Identified
[Items one reviewer caught that others missed — require orchestrator judgment]

## Consensus
[Items all reviewers agree on — lower scrutiny needed]
```

"No conflicts found" is a valid but suspicious outcome — orchestrator should verify this isn't lazy cross-review.

### Phase 4: Meta-Review (Orchestrator as Intent Guardian)

**Input:** Review results + Cross-Review Report (if 2+ reviewers)

1. Did reviewer cite specific evidence (not just "looks correct")?
2. **Spot-check** — read actual code yourself:
   - 1 reviewer → minimum 1 spot-check
   - 2-3 reviewers → minimum 2 (highest-risk + 1 random)
   - 4+ reviewers → minimum 3
3. If Cross-Review Report exists: resolve all Contested Findings with your own judgment
4. **Intent Comparison Protocol** — for each agent recommendation:
   - Re-read Intent Anchor (list IA-1 through IA-N)
   - Write: `Recommendation X → IA-N: ALIGNED/CONFLICTS — [reason]`
   - Any CONFLICTS → reject recommendation or find alternative that preserves intent
   - Record WHY each acceptance/rejection was made
5. Gap check:
   - Thorough + intent-aligned → proceed to Phase 5
   - Vague or missed obvious gaps → re-launch Review Agent
   - Spot-check fails → both analysis and review suspect → return to Phase 2

**Self-enforcement Checklist (MUST complete before proceeding):**
- [ ] Intent Anchor listed? (cite IA-1 through IA-N)
- [ ] Each recommendation compared against Intent Anchor? (show comparison)
- [ ] Accept/reject reasoning documented?
- [ ] Spot-checks completed? (needed: X, done: Y)
- [ ] Cross-review report referenced? (if 2+ reviewers)
- [ ] Runtime verification results reviewed? (reviewer produced traces: YES/NO, spot-checked: X)
- [ ] Overall: intent preserved? (YES with evidence / NO → do not proceed)

### Phase 5: Plan (Work Agent)

For each gap: file, change, why, predicted effect.

**Success criteria rules:**
- MUST describe **observable behavior**, NOT file contents
- BAD: "file.js contains newFunction()"
- GOOD: "When counter reaches 100, delta triggers exactly once"

Include regression checks with verification method.

### Phase 6: Review Plan (Review Agent)

- Coverage: every gap addressed?
- Correctness: will changes close gaps?
- Regression risk per change (NONE / LOW / HIGH)
- Success criteria: observable behavior, testable?
- Per-change verdict + overall APPROVED / NEEDS REVISION

### Phase 7: Meta-Review Plan (Orchestrator + User)

**Input:** Plan review results + Cross-Review Report (if 2+ reviewers)

1. Count: N gaps → N addressed in review?
2. **Spot-check** (same scaling as Phase 4): verify highest-risk change(s)
3. If Cross-Review Report exists: resolve all Contested Findings
4. **Intent Comparison Protocol** — for each planned change:
   - Re-read Intent Anchor (list IA-1 through IA-N)
   - Write: `Change X → IA-N: ALIGNED/CONFLICTS — [reason]`
   - Any CONFLICTS → revise plan to preserve intent
5. Scope drift: plan grown beyond or shrunk below original intent?
6. **Self-enforcement Checklist** (same as Phase 4 — MUST complete before presenting to user)
7. Present summary + Intent Anchor comparison → get user approval before implementing

### Phase 7.5: Alternative Proposal (Optional)

Only when genuinely better approach exists:

| Propose | Do NOT propose |
|---------|----------------|
| Better achieves the intent | Just "simpler" or "faster" |
| Can explain WHY | Gut feeling / pattern matching |
| Verifiable improvement | Skips steps to save time |
| Maintains all constraints | Ignores some requirements |

If accepted → return to Phase 5, full review cycle again.
**"Better" means better achieves intent, not faster to implement.**

### Phase 8: Implement (Work Agent)

Execute plan exactly. No improvisation.

**If reality differs from plan → STOP.** This is a plan-reality gap. Return to Phase 5-7 for revision.
**"Different from plan but better" → Stop. Revise plan. Get approval. Then implement.**

**Runtime Verification (mandatory):**
After implementation, verify that your changes will actually work when deployed/applied in practice:
1. Identify the trigger (what causes this change to take effect? User action, system event, someone reading this document, a function call, etc.)
2. Trace the full path from trigger to intended result — step by step, through the actual system
3. Identify all conditions that must be true for the intended result to occur
4. Check: are those conditions actually met in the real context?
5. If any condition fails or the result is unreachable → this is an implementation gap. STOP and report.

Format:
```
Trigger: [what initiates this]
→ [step 1]: [what happens]
→ [step 2]: [what happens]
→ ...
→ Result: [intended observable effect]
Conditions: [what must be true for this to work]
Verdict: WORKS / BROKEN — [reason]
```

This is not optional. If you can verify it, you must. "Can verify but didn't" = violation.

### Phase 9: Verify (Review Agent)

For each criterion:
1. Read actual implementation
2. **Runtime Verification** — independently verify the implementation will work in practice (do NOT trust Work Agent's results):
   a. Identify the trigger (what causes this to take effect?)
   b. Follow the full path through the actual system (read the files, trace the flow)
   c. At each step: what state exists? what conditions are checked? what happens next?
   d. Does the path reach the intended result?
   e. Produce verification in same format as Phase 8
3. Compare your trace against Work Agent's trace — discrepancies = findings
4. Predict observable behavior based on YOUR trace
5. Compare against criterion
6. Verdict: PASS or FAIL with explanation

**Rules:**
- "File contains X" is NEVER valid verification. Predict behavior.
- Only PASS / FAIL. No "mostly works."
- Cannot predict behavior → say CANNOT VERIFY explicitly
- If reference exists, structural comparison is MANDATORY:
  1. Read reference structure (layout, components, ordering)
  2. Read implementation structure
  3. Compare: structurally identical?
  4. List EVERY structural difference
  5. Verdict: MATCHES / DIFFERS (with specific diff list)

### Phase 10: Meta-Verify (Orchestrator as Intent Guardian)

**Input:** Verification results + Cross-Review Report (if 2+ reviewers)

1. Did reviewer predict behavior for each PASS (not just "matches")?
2. **Spot-check** (same scaling as Phase 4) — read actual code yourself. **NON-NEGOTIABLE.**
3. If Cross-Review Report exists: resolve all Contested Findings — these are your highest-priority items
4. If spot-check contradicts reviewer → both verification and implementation suspect
5. If reviewer gave vague PASS → reject, re-launch with specific instructions
6. **Runtime Verification** — the most critical check:
   - Did Review Agent produce runtime verification for each criterion?
   - Does the verification show the implementation will actually work when deployed/applied?
   - Spot-check at least 1 verification: trace the path yourself through the actual system
   - If Review Agent skipped runtime verification → reject, re-launch
   - If result is BROKEN → implementation failed regardless of other checks
7. **Final Intent Comparison Protocol** — for the implemented result:
   - Re-read Intent Anchor (list IA-1 through IA-N)
   - For each IA item: `IA-N → SATISFIED/VIOLATED — [evidence from implementation]`
   - Any VIOLATED → return to appropriate phase
8. **Self-enforcement Checklist** (same as Phase 4 — MUST complete before proceeding to Report)
9. On failure, return to appropriate phase:
   - Implementation wrong → Phase 8
   - Plan was flawed → Phase 5
   - Analysis was wrong → Phase 2

### Phase 11: Report (Orchestrator)

```
## Changes Made
[Files and modifications]

## Verification Results
Per criterion: description, reviewer verdict, my spot-check

## Regression Check Results
Per behavior: description, verdict

## User Testing Needed
[What cannot be verified statically]

## Post-Workflow Documentation
- [ ] Ticket updated: `/ticketing P{NNN}_T{NNN}` (if executing from ticket)
- [ ] Other documents updated: `/discussing`, `/researching`, `/planning` (as needed)
```

Final gap check: "Is this the intended result?"

### Post-Workflow: Document (mandatory)

After workflow completion, document the work using the appropriate skill:

- `/ticketing P{NNN}_T{NNN}` — update ticket with work log entry (if executing from a ticket)
- `/discussing "topic"` — record decisions or dialogue outcomes
- `/researching "topic"` — record investigation findings or analysis results
- `/planning "topic"` — record if a new plan was derived

At minimum, the relevant ticket's work log (`/ticketing` update) MUST be updated.

## Orchestrator Scope

| Does | Does NOT |
|------|----------|
| Check reviewer cited specific evidence | Re-read all files reviewer read |
| Spot-check claims (scaled to reviewer count) | Verify every single claim |
| Run cross-review when 2+ reviewers, resolve contested findings | Skip cross-review to save time |
| Check process quality (rules followed?) | Redo the entire review |
| Filter review through original intent | Blindly accept reviewer suggestions |
| Override feedback that drifts from intent | Let reviewers redirect work |
| Catch obvious oversights | Deep-dive every corner |

---

## Parallel Execution

### Batch Pattern

```
Batch 1:
  Work A → Review A ─┐
  Work B → Review B ─┤── Cross-Review (BLOCKING) ── Orchestrator (intent check)
  Work C → Review C ─┘

Batch 2 (depends on Batch 1): ...
```

### Rules

- **1:1 Pairing**: Every Work Agent has a dedicated Review Agent
- **Independence**: Agents in a batch must not depend on each other
- **Dependency ordering**: Dependent tasks → separate batches

### Context Budget

Split by **logical boundaries** first (module, layer, feature), then check tokens:

| Work Type | Files per Agent | Reason |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Search/Read | 10-20 | Minimal reasoning |
| Code modification | 3-5 | Understanding + modification + verification |
| Complex refactoring | 1-2 | Most context on comprehension |

If budget exceeds ~80-100K tokens → split further. If room → merge small tasks.

**Orchestrator assignment:** extract tasks → build dependency graph → group into batches → estimate budget → split or merge.

### Cross-Review Protocol

Cross-review is NOT a coherence check. It is adversarial cross-examination — reviewers challenge each other's conclusions.

See **Phase 3.5 / 6.5 / 9.5** for full procedure and output format.

**Key principle:** Reviewers don't just check "do our findings align?" — they ask "did the other reviewer miss something I caught? Do I disagree with their verdict? Can I break their reasoning?"

**BLOCKING:** Meta-Review phases (4, 7, 10) require the Cross-Review Report as input when 2+ reviewers ran in parallel. Skipping cross-review to save time is Anti-pattern #20.

### Integration Review (Intent Guardian)

After cross-review:
1. Re-read Intent Anchor (IA-1 through IA-N) — this IS the immovable anchor
2. For each agent's work: `Agent output → IA-N: ALIGNED/CONFLICTS — [reason]`
3. "Does all this together satisfy every IA item?"
4. "Have reviewer suggestions shifted any IA item?"
5. **Accept** quality improvements that preserve all IA items; **override** drift

---

## Processing Agent Responses

1. Does agent's understanding match your intent? → If not, re-instruct
2. Does result answer the question? → If not, follow up
3. Review Agent: specific evidence, not just "looks good"?
4. Does this response change your understanding?

---

## Anti-Patterns

| # | Pattern | Rule |
|---|---------|------|
| 1 | Orchestrator doing agent work | Analysis/planning/implementation/verification = agent tasks |
| 2 | Delegating understanding | Phase 1 is YOUR job |
| 3 | "File contains X" verification | Predict behavior, not text existence |
| 4 | Agents for grep | Deep analysis → agents. Text search → Grep/Glob |
| 5 | Proceeding without verification | "Probably understood" = gap |
| 6 | Ignoring small gaps | Small gaps → large rework |
| 7 | Trusting agent output blindly | Both Work and Review agents can have gaps |
| 8 | Modifying without plan update | Reality ≠ plan → fix plan first |
| 9 | "Partial success" | Only Pass/Fail. No middle ground |
| 10 | Understanding without inference | Can't predict consequences → don't understand |
| 11 | Shortcuts as "improvements" | Faster ≠ better |
| 12 | "Different from plan but better" | Stop → revise plan → approve → implement |
| 13 | Accepting proposals blindly | User proposals need understanding too |
| 14 | Skipping Phase 2 | No analysis = no understanding |
| 15 | "Can't verify without running" | Trace execution, compare state, analyze deps |
| 16 | Same agent for Work and Review | Reviewer needs fresh context |
| 17 | Vague review: "looks correct" | Require specific evidence |
| 18 | Skipping meta-verify spot-check | Non-negotiable. Read actual code for at least 1 item |
| 19 | Work without review | No Work Agent runs solo |
| 20 | Skipping cross-review | 2+ parallel reviewers → Cross-Review Report is BLOCKING. Meta-Review without it is invalid. Completion drive is not an excuse. |
| 21 | Orchestrator as aggregator | Verify intent alignment, don't just compile |
| 22 | Token-first splitting | Split by module/feature first, tokens second |
| 23 | Reviewer-driven drift | Reviewers improve quality, not redefine goals |
| 24 | Intent erosion through iterations | Re-anchor to Intent Anchor (IA-N items) every meta-review — run Intent Comparison Protocol |
| 25 | Skipping runtime verification | Verification without tracing actual execution path is incomplete. "Code exists" ≠ "Code runs." Can verify but didn't = violation. |

## Quick Reference

```
Task → Phase 1: Understand + Intent Anchor (IA-1..N)
     → Phase 2-4: Analyze → Review → [Cross-Review] → Meta-Review + Intent Comparison
     → Phase 5-7: Plan → Review → [Cross-Review] → Meta-Review + Intent Comparison + Approve
     → Phase 7.5: Alternative (optional)
     → Phase 8-10: Implement → Verify → [Cross-Review] → Meta-Verify + Intent Comparison
     → Phase 11: Report

[Cross-Review] = Phase 3.5/6.5/9.5 — BLOCKING when 2+ reviewers
Intent Comparison = re-read IA items, compare each recommendation, document ALIGNED/CONFLICTS

3-Layer: Work Agent → Review Agent → Orchestrator (Intent Guardian)
Understanding = Gap closed + Consequences predicted
Orchestrator = Synthesize + Critique + Preserve Intent Anchor
Spot-checks scale: 1 reviewer→1, 2-3→2, 4+→3
If gap remains → do not proceed
If recommendation CONFLICTS with any IA item → reject or find alternative
```
