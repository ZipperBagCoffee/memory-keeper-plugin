name: memory-delta
description: "Auto-executes when the [MEMORY_KEEPER_DELTA] trigger is detected. Launches delta-processor background agent to summarize and append to memory.md without blocking. Not user-invocable — triggered automatically."

## Node.js Path
Use the Node.js absolute path from your context's "Node.js Path" section (injected by the plugin on every prompt).
If not available in context, fall back to `node`.

## Script Path Resolution

**IMPORTANT:** The `scripts/` folder is in the plugin directory, NOT the current project.

From "Base directory for this skill:" above, derive the scripts path:
- Remove `/skills/memory-delta` from the end
- Add `/scripts/` to get the scripts directory

Example: if Base directory is `~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../skills/memory-delta`, then Scripts path is derived by removing `/skills/memory-delta` and appending `/scripts/`.

Use this full path when running node commands below.

## Project Root Resolution

**IMPORTANT:** Get the project root from your context's "Project Root Anchor" section.
Look for: `Your ACTUAL project root is: <path>`

Use this value as `{PROJECT_DIR}` in all commands below.
If not available in context, use your current working directory.

## Trigger Condition

Auto-invoked when EITHER:
1. Hook stderr outputs: `[MEMORY_KEEPER_DELTA] file=delta_temp.txt`
2. Context contains: `[MEMORY_KEEPER_DELTA]` trigger pattern

If you see `[MEMORY_KEEPER_DELTA]` anywhere in your context, execute this skill immediately.

## Execution Steps

1. **Verify file exists first** (DO NOT SKIP):
   Use the Read tool to read `{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/memory/delta_temp.txt` (limit 5 lines). If file not found or empty, STOP HERE - do not proceed.

2. **Check processing lock** (race condition prevention):
   Use the Read tool to read `{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/memory/delta_processing.lock`. If not found, proceed.
   - If lock file exists AND is less than 5 minutes old → STOP (another processor is running). Log: "Delta processing already in progress, skipping."
   - If lock file exists AND is older than 5 minutes → stale lock, proceed (will be overwritten by agent).
   - If lock file does not exist → proceed.

   To check lock age:
   ```bash
   "{NODE_PATH}" -e "const fs=require('fs');try{const s=fs.statSync('{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/memory/delta_processing.lock');const age=(Date.now()-s.mtimeMs)/60000;console.log(age<5?'FRESH':'STALE')}catch(e){console.log('NONE')}"
   ```
   If output is `FRESH`, the lock is active — STOP. If `STALE` or `NONE`, proceed.

3. **Call delta-processor background agent**:
   Use the `delta-processor` agent (defined in `agents/delta-processor.md`).
   Call with `run_in_background: true`.

   Prompt (replace all placeholders with actual resolved paths):
   ```
   Process the delta file and append summary to memory.md.

   DELTA_PATH: {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/memory/delta_temp.txt
   MEMORY_PATH: {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/memory/memory.md
   NODE_PATH: {NODE_PATH}
   SCRIPTS_PATH: {SCRIPTS_PATH}
   PROJECT_DIR: {PROJECT_DIR}
   LOCK_PATH: {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/memory/delta_processing.lock
   ```

   The agent runs in the background and handles steps 2-6 of the old flow:
   - Summarize (1 sentence per ~200 words)
   - Validate summary
   - Append to memory.md with dual timestamps
   - Run mark-updated
   - Run cleanup
   - Release lock

4. **Done** — the main conversation is not blocked. The delta-processor agent will complete in the background and results will be delivered when ready.

## Foreground Fallback

If the delta-processor agent call fails (e.g., agent not found, background execution not supported), fall back to the legacy foreground flow:

**Fallback Step 2**: Call `delta-summarizer` agent (foreground):
   Prompt: "Read {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/memory/delta_temp.txt and summarize (1 sentence per ~200 words)."

**Fallback Step 3**: Validate response:
   - If response starts with "ERROR:" → STOP
   - If response is empty → STOP

**Fallback Step 4**: Append summary to memory.md:
   Write the summary to a temp file first, then use append-memory.js:
   1. Use the Write tool to save the summary to `{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/memory/delta_summary_temp.txt`
   2. Run:
   ```bash
   "{NODE_PATH}" "{SCRIPTS_PATH}/append-memory.js" --project-dir="{PROJECT_DIR}"
   ```

**Fallback Step 5**: Update timestamp marker:
   ```bash
   "{NODE_PATH}" "{SCRIPTS_PATH}/extract-delta.js" mark-updated --project-dir="{PROJECT_DIR}"
   ```

**Fallback Step 6**: Delete temp file:
   ```bash
   "{NODE_PATH}" "{SCRIPTS_PATH}/extract-delta.js" cleanup --project-dir="{PROJECT_DIR}"
   ```

## Failure Handling

- If file doesn't exist in step 1: STOP immediately
- If lock is fresh in step 2: STOP (another processor running)
- If background agent call fails in step 3: Use Foreground Fallback above
- If fallback also fails: Don't update timestamp, don't delete temp file
- Next trigger will retry with accumulated content (temp file overwritten)
