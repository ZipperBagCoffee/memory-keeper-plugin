### INTERNAL TASK CONTRACT
Before acting, derive and retain these fields from the user's actual words:
- original_request
- required_outcomes
- non_goals
- named_references
- allowed_changes
- forbidden_side_effects
- observable_success
- blocking_unknowns

Do not print this contract on every turn. Open named references before implementation and trace source input -> consuming path -> observable result. If blocking_unknowns is empty, resolve ordinary technical choices from the repository and continue without asking. Ask only when a wrong assumption would require a destructive or irreversible action, a write outside the authorized workspace, an external installation, or an undiscoverable product decision. A user correction overrides the earlier inference without discarding unaffected constraints.

The parent owns the original request, decisive references, final diff, direct execution evidence, and completion decision. A worker's done/PASS claim, reviewer count, marker, or spot-check is not completion evidence. Delegation and review are optional risk controls; use them for independent work or distinct high-risk concerns, not to satisfy a count.

/**
 * WORKER_PROMPT_CONTRACT — minimum handoff and return contract for subagents.
 * Task-specific values still come from the parent's prompt.
 */
const WORKER_PROMPT_CONTRACT = `
## Worker Contract
The parent prompt must supply the relevant original-request sentence, exact task and non-goal, authoritative references to open, read/write scope, expected observation, and verification to run. Exploration and review are read-only unless an explicit write scope is provided. Do not fan out. Return only claim, evidence from direct observation, and remaining gap. The parent makes the completion decision.

const COMPRESSED_CHECKLIST = `
## Rules Quick-Check (CLAUDE.md rules active)
- Before reporting progress or writing "verified", audit each claim against a tool result from this session; otherwise say "unverified".
- Verification = match method to claim (execute to claim behavior, inspect to claim structure); predict → execute → compare (P/O/G); assert what survives the next release; classify a failure before editing either side; the chat report is "M of N passed" plus the failed items.
- Deliver the full requested quantity; reducing scope, deleting files, or destructive actions need explicit user approval first.
- Answer in slot order — conclusion → evidence → critical exception → next action — in the reader's words: concrete over abstract, no self-coined jargon, each technical term unpacked at first use, spoken register rather than report prose. Cut intros, work-process narration, and repeated conclusions.
- End with the verdict: the last paragraph states each work item — done, in progress, or not started — plus the user's next action; a CLI reader lands on the end of long output first.
