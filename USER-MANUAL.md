# Crabshell User Manual (v21.123.0)

## Why Do You Need This?

Claude Code **forgets everything when a session ends:**
- Work you did yesterday
- Decisions and their reasons
- Project structure
- Bugs found and how you fixed them

Every new session, you have to repeat: "This project is built with React, uses Zustand for state management, JWT for auth..." and so on.

Crabshell solves this problem.

## Installation

In Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add ZipperBagCoffee/crabshell
/plugin install crabshell
```

**That's it.** It works automatically after installation.

### Codex Native Installation

On Windows or Linux, install from the GitHub marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add ZipperBagCoffee/crabshell --ref master
codex plugin add crabshell@crabshell-repo
codex plugin list
```

For local development, `codex plugin marketplace add .` works only when `.` is the Crabshell repository root containing `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; it does not work from an unrelated target project.

Start a new Codex session, review/trust the Crabshell hook definition, and invoke `crabshell:status`. It reports live installed, activated, trusted, behavior-verified, degraded, drifted, and unsupported states for Claude Code CLI and Codex CLI. Codex desktop-app evidence is kept separate. The old `/crabshell:install-codex` command remains a legacy/development bridge.

Codex automatically loads existing memory/workflow context at SessionStart and uses native prompt, compaction, subagent, command-observation, and completion hooks. Explicit load/save/search skills remain available. Claude retains its automatic SessionEnd capture and pressure/sycophancy system; neither host launches the other.

---

## Basic Usage (Automatic)

### What Happens in Claude Code

**1. Session Start:**
- Previous session summary (`logbook.md`) loaded into Claude's context
- L3 summaries of archived memory loaded
- Project info you set (`project.md`) loaded
- CLAUDE.md rules synced and injected

**2. During Work:**
- Auto-save triggers every 15 tool uses (configurable)
- Delta extracted from L1 session log, Haiku summarizes in background (non-blocking), appended to `logbook.md`
- Auto-rotation when `logbook.md` exceeds ~23,750 tokens
- Rules re-injected every prompt via COMPRESSED_CHECKLIST
- CLAUDE.md rules section kept in sync automatically
- Project concept anchor: `project.md` injected into context every prompt for drift prevention
- Prompt-aware memory snippets loaded into context based on relevance

**3. Session End:**
- After an execution-authorized turn, the full conversation is backed up (`.l1.jsonl`) and the final delta is extracted.
- A question-only session does not create Crabshell bookkeeping writes.

### What Happens in Codex

- SessionStart reads the same project memory and active D/P/T/W workflow context without modifying it.
- UserPromptSubmit supplies the shared scoped task contract and concise core rules. Polite action requests authorize that work; quoted commands and inspection questions do not authorize edits.
- PreCompact/PostCompact recover memory and workflow context; SubagentStart supplies the current task/non-goals/references/success contract.
- PostToolUse records decisive parent command results. SubagentStop is only a child claim; Stop requires parent evidence and bounds identical retry failures.
- Interrupt preserves a paused record and invalidates earlier test success. Historical work records never authorize resuming stopped work.
- Use `crabshell:save-memory` for an explicit Codex session note. Codex does not invoke Claude's SessionEnd capture or pressure counters.

## Memory Rotation

When `logbook.md` grows beyond **23,750 tokens** (~95KB):
1. Current content archived to `logbook_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`
2. Last **2,375 tokens** kept as carryover
3. Haiku agent generates L3 JSON summary of the archived content

### Search Across All Layers

**Use slash command (recommended):**
```
/crabshell:search-memory auth
```

**Or ask Claude directly:**
> "Search memory for authentication related work"

---

## Slash Commands

All available skills (slash commands):

### Memory Management

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/crabshell:save-memory` | Trigger an immediate memory save |
| `/crabshell:load-memory` | Reload memory context (useful after manual edits or compaction) |
| `/crabshell:search-memory keyword` | Search past sessions across L1/L2/L3 layers. Flags: `--regex`, `--context=N`, `--limit=N` |
| `/crabshell:clear-memory` | Clean up old memory files |

### Structured Work (D/P/T/I/H Documents)

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/crabshell:discussing "topic"` | Create or update a Discussion document (D) |
| `/crabshell:planning "topic"` | Create or update a Plan document (P) |
| `/crabshell:ticketing P001 "title"` | Create or update a Ticket document (T) linked to a plan |
| `/crabshell:investigating "topic"` | Run a multi-agent Investigation (I) |
| `/crabshell:hotfix "description"` | Record directly-performed one-pass work (H) — one-line fixes up to small multi-file changes, with Problem/Fix/Verification; or `/crabshell:hotfix H001` to update |

### Workflows

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/crabshell:regressing "topic"` | Iterative current-gap Plan→Ticket→Verify cycles until convergence; an explicit count is only a maximum |
| `/crabshell:verifying` | Create or run project-specific verification tools |
| `/crabshell:verifying wiring` | Refresh the pipeline connection inventory: re-discover hooks, trigger tokens, and agents, approve new or removed hops into `wiring-contract.json`, and regenerate the optional architecture map when `arch-explorer:build` is installed (v21.121.0) |
| `/crabshell:status` | Live host/plugin state: installed, activated, trusted, behavior-verified, degraded, drifted, unsupported |
| `/crabshell:lint` | Run Obsidian document lint checks (orphans, broken wikilinks, stale status, missing frontmatter, INDEX inconsistencies) |
| `/crabshell:search-docs query` | BM25 full-text search across all D/P/T/I/W/K documents — ranked results with title/tags/id/body field boosts |
| `/crabshell:knowledge "title"` | Create a K-page (verified fact or operational tip) in .crabshell/knowledge/; or `/crabshell:knowledge K001` to view |

### Setup

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/crabshell:setup-project` | Initialize project configuration (project.md, config) |
| `/crabshell:install-codex` | Legacy/development bridge into Codex locations; prefer native Codex marketplace installation |
| `/crabshell:setup-rtk` | Install and configure RTK (Rust Token Killer) for token-optimized CLI output |

> **Tip:** For basic memory operations, you can also just ask Claude directly (e.g., "save memory now", "search memory for auth").

### Codex Bundled Skills

Installed Codex skills are invoked by name, including `crabshell:load-memory`, `crabshell:save-memory`, `crabshell:search-memory`, and `crabshell:status`. Memory and document launchers resolve from the installed plugin and target the active project, so the project does not need its own `scripts/`. The seven document skills require an absolute `--project-dir` and invoke the shared document engine from their own skill directory. SessionStart loads shared memory/workflow state; when only a legacy project description exists, it copies that file to the canonical path without deleting the original.

---

## Document System (D/P/T/I)

Crabshell includes a structured document system for organizing complex work.

### Document Types

| Type | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **D** | Discussion | Explore a topic, capture decisions, frame the problem |
| **P** | Plan | Concrete implementation plan derived from a Discussion |
| **T** | Ticket | Specific work item derived from a Plan |
| **I** | Investigation | Independent multi-agent research on a topic |

### Hierarchy

```
D (Discussion) → P (Plan) → T (Ticket)
I (Investigation) — independent, not part of the D→P→T chain
```

- Status cascades upward: when all Tickets under a Plan complete, the Plan completes; when all Plans under a Discussion complete, the Discussion completes.
- Documents are stored in `docs/` (local only, not committed to git).
- Each document has a log section that tracks all work done against it.

### Regressing (Iterative Improvement)

Use `/crabshell:regressing "topic"` for tasks that need multiple rounds of refinement:
- Creates a single Discussion (D) as wrapper with measurable `## Convergence Criteria`
- Runs one current-gap Plan (P) then Ticket (T) cycle at a time until the result converges
- Each cycle's scope is determined by the previous cycle's verification results, not pre-allocated
- Prints a ready-to-paste `/goal` line — start host goal mode (Claude Code 2.1.139+ or Codex CLI 0.128.0+) and the host keeps the session running until the D's Convergence Criteria are met or the cycle cap is reached

### Hotfix (One-Shot Tasks)

For a standalone task that does not need the full D/P/T trail, do the work directly and record it with `/crabshell:hotfix` (Problem/Fix/Verification). The former `/crabshell:light-workflow` skill was retired in v21.112.0 — existing W worklogs under `.crabshell/worklog/` remain readable history, and in-flight W documents from earlier versions are still honored by workflow restart context.

---

## Core Philosophy

Crabshell supplies the same core task and evidence rules through each host's native hooks. Claude also synchronizes its managed CLAUDE.md section; Codex receives native hook context and uses project AGENTS.md guidance. You do not need to make one host launch the other.

### Internal Understanding
Claude builds an internal eight-field task contract before implementation: the original request, required outcomes, non-goals, named references, allowed changes, forbidden side effects, observable success, and blocking unknowns. It continues through discoverable or non-blocking uncertainty and asks only when a destructive/irreversible action, outside-workspace change, external installation, or undiscoverable product choice requires user authority.

### Verification-First
Before claiming any result is verified, Claude must:
1. **Predict** what it expects to observe
2. **Execute** (run code, use tools) to get actual results
3. **Compare** prediction vs. observation

The chat report is `"M of N passed"` plus the failed items — never the Prediction/Observation/Gap (P/O/G) table itself, never a list of passing items, never raw observations (v21.115.0/.1, I085). Verification depth is unchanged; only what reaches the screen changed. Reading a file and declaring it correct is still not verification.

### Parent-Owned Orchestration
The parent agent may delegate independent inspection, implementation, or review tasks when that lowers risk or latency. Worker prompts must include the relevant original request, task and non-goal, authoritative references, read/write scope, expected observation, and verification method. Explore/review workers are read-only and workers do not fan out.

Completion remains with the parent. A worker's `done`/`PASS`, agent count, or spot-check is not decisive evidence; the parent resolves named references, inspects the resulting diff, runs the decisive command or behavior check, checks forbidden side effects, and reports the observed gap.

### Portable Behavioral Verification

The verifying skill installs one schema-v2 runner from `skills/verifying/scripts/run-verify.js`. Manifest commands use repo-relative `file` and `args` fields. Behavioral entries must assert independently observed JSON/file state and may protect paths with before/after snapshots. A zero exit or stdout containing `PASS` cannot satisfy the contract by itself.

As of v21.121.0 (D116) the skill also checks that a project's **pipeline is still wired**. For a Claude Code plugin project it copies `skills/verifying/scripts/check-pipeline-wiring.js` next to the runner, runs `discover` to list candidate hops — every `hooks/hooks.json` command (event, matcher, script, args), every `[CRABSHELL_*]` trigger token with the scripts that emit it and the skills that consume it, and every `agents/*.md` name referenced by a skill — and the parent approves that list into `.crabshell/verification/wiring-contract.json`. Each approved hop becomes one `structural` manifest entry (`check --contract … --hop <id>`), plus one completeness entry (`--completeness`) that fails whenever a hook, token, or agent file exists in the source but is neither approved nor listed under `ignore`. The contract is approved, never copied from discovery: discovery only sees the current source, so a deleted hop disappears from discovery too, and only the approved list can catch the deletion. To prove the probe bites, run it with `--hooks <fixture copy>` where one entry has been removed and watch `passed:false` / `hook-entry-missing` — the live hooks.json is never edited. If the `arch-explorer:build` skill is installed, Step 2a also generates a clickable architecture map at `.crabshell/verification/architecture/index.html`; it is documentation and a coverage hint for approving hops, never parsed and never a pass/fail input, and its state (`generated`, `unavailable`, `generation-failed`) is only recorded.

As of v21.116.0 the skill also decides *what* to assert, so verifiers survive releases instead of needing an edit each time (D114/I086):

- **Match the method to the claim.** "Running this produces that" must be executed and observed. "This artifact has this structure or wiring" is read and parsed. A static check standing in for a behavioral claim is the common defect — grepping for `process.exit(0)` does not verify fail-open, injecting a malformed input and watching the exit code does.
- **Never write down a value the next release will change.** Compare a version against the authoritative source rather than a literal; assert `discovered > 0` and `failures == 0` instead of a test count; assert required shape instead of full printed text; assert a relation across two runs instead of one input/output pair. Exact literals stay correct where the spelling itself is the contract — protocol event names, JSON property names, CLI flags.
- **A failing entry means the code is wrong until shown otherwise.** Run mode classifies first: unchanged contract → fix the code; deliberately changed contract → edit the verifier and state that in the report; incidental copied output → rewrite the assertion as structure or relation. Silently re-recording current output is not verification.

These rules are automatically injected into CLAUDE.md and reinforced every prompt.

## Hooks

The plugin uses Claude Code hooks to run automatically:

| Hook | Script | When It Runs | What It Does |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `inject-rules.js` | Every prompt | Emits the compact shared turn contract (4-line Rules Quick-Check); Claude-host `## Codex Delegation` guidance on execution turns only; `봉인해제` / `UNLEASH` immediately resets pressure counters; execution prompts run once-per-session cleanup/reset and Claude rule/memory-warning synchronization. Three-field response ending and pressure texts retired v21.113.0 (I083) |
| `SessionStart` | `load-memory.js` | Session begins | Loads logbook, summaries, canonical project memory, and active workflow; legacy-only descriptions are copied without overwriting existing data |
| `PostToolUse` | `counter.js check` | After each tool use | Increments counter; triggers auto-save + delta extraction at interval |
| `PreToolUse` | `regressing-guard.js` | Before Write/Edit | Enforces phase-based restrictions during active regressing sessions |
| `PreToolUse` | `docs-guard.js` | Before Write/Edit to docs/ | Blocks writes to docs/ directories without active skill flag |
| `PreToolUse` | `log-guard.js` | Before Write/Edit | Blocks INDEX.md terminal status without log entries; blocks cycle docs without previous cycle logs |
| `PreToolUse` | `verify-guard.js` | Before Write/Edit to tickets | Hybrid: Edit always enforces; Write enforces only for existing files (new file creation skips). Blocks Final Verification without prior `/verifying` run |
| `PreToolUse` | `path-guard.js` | Before Read/Grep/Glob/Bash/Write/Edit | Blocks wrong path, Edit on logbook.md, Write shrink on logbook.md |
| `PreToolUse` | `web-guard.js` | Before WebFetch/WebSearch | Blocks WebFetch with a URL-substituted raw-fetch redirect (trafilatura → r.jina.ai → curl); blocks WebSearch only when a search MCP is configured, otherwise allows with a snippet-verification warning (v21.114.0) |
| `PostToolUse` | `verification-sequence.js record` | After each successful tool use | Tracks source edits and passing declared checks using Claude-specific result handling |
| `PreToolUse` | `verification-sequence.js gate` | Before Write/Edit/Bash | Blocks git commit without tests |
| `PreToolUse` | `doc-watchdog.js gate` | Before Write/Edit | Soft warning (additionalContext) when 5+ code edits without D/P/T doc update (regressing only) |
| `PostToolUse` | `doc-watchdog.js record` | After Write/Edit | Tracks code file edits (increment counter) and D/P/T doc edits (reset counter) in doc-watchdog.json |
| `PostToolUse` | `completion-controller.js` | After Bash, Write, or Edit | Records declared parent check results after a child claim and invalidates evidence when project content changes |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | `verification-sequence.js record` + `completion-controller.js` | After failed Claude Bash calls | Records failure/interruption and invalidates prior success; commit and Stop remain the blocking boundaries |
| `PreToolUse` | `completion-controller.js` | Before Claude Bash calls | Records declared check invocation identity and order for parent evidence |
| `PostToolUse` | `skill-tracker.js` | After Skill tool call | Sets skill-active flag on Skill tool calls for guard scripts |
| `Stop`, `SubagentStop` | `completion-controller.js` | Child/parent completion boundary | One state owner: child claim is not proof; requires parent evidence, bounds identical failures, preserves workflow continuation, and runs the retained doc-watchdog Stop validator (sycophancy/scope/pressure guards unwired v21.113.0) |
| `PreCompact` | `pre-compact.js` | Before context compaction | Outputs memory state, active documents, and regressing state as context to preserve across compaction |
| `PostCompact` | `post-compact.js` | After context compaction | Logs compaction event for debugging (side-effect only, no context output) |
| `SubagentStart` | `subagent-context.js` | When subagent spawns | Injects project concept, COMPRESSED_CHECKLIST, regressing state, and project root anchor into subagent context |
| `SessionEnd` | `counter.js final` | Execution-authorized session ends | Creates final L1 backup and extracts remaining delta; question-only sessions remain read-only |

Hook launchers invoke Node directly; `scripts/find-node.sh` is a fallback utility. Since v21.123.0, Claude `PostToolUseFailure` for Bash runs `verification-sequence.js record` and `completion-controller.js`. It records failures; blocking remains at PreToolUse commit and Stop decisions. PreToolUse Bash also tells the controller which check started, so late results cannot replace a newer invocation.

### Codex Hook Surface

| Hook | Script | When It Runs | What It Does |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `SessionStart` | `adapters/codex/session-start.js` | Session begins | Shared memory and workflow recovery, including preserving legacy-description copy when needed |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `adapters/codex/user-prompt-submit.js` | Every prompt | Shared compact turn contract without the Claude-only Codex delegation block; execution lifecycle writes to Codex plugin data/project state |
| `PreToolUse` | `adapters/codex/pre-tool-use.js` | Matching local file/shell tools | Applies shared memory path policy, records check starts and blocks commit without a current passing check |
| `PostToolUse` | `adapters/codex/post-tool-use.js` | After Bash, Write, or Edit | Normalizes commands; binds output-only hooks to explicit native transcript exit codes; updates parent and commit evidence with shared content identity |
| `PreCompact` | `adapters/codex/pre-compact.js` | Before compaction | Emits shared memory/workflow recovery context without writes |
| `PostCompact` | `adapters/codex/post-compact.js` | After compaction | Restores shared context while keeping Claude-specific compaction effects in Claude only |
| `SubagentStart` | `adapters/codex/subagent-start.js` | Child starts | Supplies exact current intent, task, non-goals, references, allowed changes, and observable success |
| `SubagentStop` | `adapters/codex/stop.js` | Child stops | Records the child result as a claim, never as completion proof |
| `Stop` | `adapters/codex/stop.js` | Parent attempts completion | Applies the shared parent-evidence and bounded-continuation decision using Codex-native block JSON |
| `Interrupt` | `adapters/codex/stop.js` | User interrupts an active turn | Saves paused work and invalidates success; records only, without blocking the interruption |

Codex reads `hooks/codex-hooks.json` through the explicit `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` `hooks` field. That prevents accidental discovery of Claude's `hooks/hooks.json`. Its events are synchronous and native; every launcher catches adapter-load and rejected-`main()` failures so infrastructure errors exit 0 without interrupting the triggering tool call. Shared semantics live in host-neutral cores, while Claude-specific SessionEnd capture stays in Claude. Retired fixed-count, role-collapse, and behavior-verifier hooks are absent from both manifests.

### Internal Task Contract and Shared Response Ending

Both native `UserPromptSubmit` paths use the shared compact contract from `scripts/core/first-turn-context.js` and the Rules Quick-Check from `scripts/shared-context.js`. The mandatory three-field ending introduced in v21.108.0 was retired in v21.113.0. The internal eight-field task contract and evidence-backed execution remain active; the response closes with clear per-item work state and next action rather than fixed labels.

The main report follows the v21.115.0 slot contract: `[conclusion] → [evidence] → [critical exception] → [next action]`, first sentence being the direct answer. Decisive observations and remaining gaps stay; the intro, work-process narration, repeated conclusions, and ceremonial closings go. The full P/O/G table lives in the D/P/T/I/H document and the chat carries `"M of N passed"` plus failures.

As of v21.106.0, the dormant behavior-verifier script, prompt, state consumer, fixed WA-count hook, and role-collapse parent-write gate are removed. Existing `behavior-verifier-state.json`, `verifier.lock`, and `wa-count.json` files are not deleted; current code ignores them. The old designs remain documented in release history only.

These defaults are not user-facing configuration knobs. They are centralized in `scripts/shared-context.js`, while `scripts/core/orchestration-policy.js` exposes deterministic helpers for the task contract, question boundary, named-reference resolution, and completion evidence.

**Related:** [Hooks](#hooks), [Configuration](#configuration), and [Pressure System](#pressure-system).

## Guards

Guard scripts are PreToolUse/Stop hooks that prevent common mistakes:

| Guard | What It Protects Against |
|-------|------------------------|
| `sycophancy-guard.js` | **Retired v21.113.0 (I083 R5)** — anti-sycophancy training in Sonnet 4.5+ replaced the hook layer; script remains on disk, unwired from PreToolUse and Stop |
| `docs-guard.js` | Direct writes to `docs/` directories outside of an active skill (discussing, planning, ticketing, etc.) |
| `log-guard.js` | Marking documents as done/verified/concluded in INDEX.md without log entries in the document; creating new cycle documents without logging the previous cycle |
| `verify-guard.js` | Writing "Final Verification" results to ticket files without actually running `/verifying` first. Hybrid: Edit always enforces; Write only enforces on existing files (new ticket creation is allowed) |
| `path-guard.js` | File operations targeting a wrong `.crabshell/memory/` path (e.g., a different project's memory directory) |
| `web-guard.js` | Built-in WebFetch/WebSearch small-model summarization (Anthropic docs: "lossy by design"; hallucinated citations in research). WebFetch is blocked with ready-to-run raw-fetch commands for the same URL; WebSearch is redirected to a configured search MCP (tavily/brave/exa/...) or, when none exists, allowed with a "snippets are pointers, fetch before citing" warning so machines without a search MCP never lose search entirely. Modes: `block` (default) / `warn` / `off` via `webGuard` in config.json (v21.114.0) |
| `core/path-policy.js` + Codex adapter | The same wrong-project memory paths in Codex; the core decides policy while each host wrapper emits its own native response format |
| `core/completion-control.js` + host adapters | Child false-done, undeclared/inconclusive checks, repeated identical failures, stale content evidence, and premature active-workflow completion. One result event reuses one content fingerprint |
| `verification-sequence.js` | Source edits before git commit without a passing declared check; unchanged content preserves existing verification |
| `doc-watchdog.js` | Document update omissions during regressing: soft warning when 5+ code edits without D/P/T document update; blocks session end when ticket has no work log since last code edit |
| `skill-tracker.js` | Supporting guard: sets the `skill-active` flag when a Skill tool call is detected, so `docs-guard` and `verify-guard` know when writes are authorized |
| `pressure-guard.js` | **Retired v21.113.0 (I083 R4)** — tool blocking removed; pressure counters remain as user-facing telemetry only (see [Pressure System](#pressure-system)) |
| `scope-guard.js` | **Retired v21.113.0 (I083 R5)** — Stop-time scope regex removed; scope preservation lives as a short RULES principle |
| `regressing-guard.js` | Phase-based write restrictions during active regressing sessions — blocks out-of-phase edits to plan/ticket documents |
| `regressing-loop-guard.js` | Retained compatibility/test helper for the old count-independent continuation path; `completion-controller.js` is now the sole manifest Stop owner. Regressing continuation is goal-driven (v21.110.0): the regressing skill prints a `/goal` handoff line for host goal mode. |

Guards run automatically via hooks. No configuration needed.
For Codex, shared path policy, completion control and the edit/commit verification state have native adapters. The document guards remain Claude-only.

---

## Pressure System

> **Status v21.113.0 (I083 R4): telemetry-only.** Model-visible pressure messages (L1/L2/L3 texts) and tool blocking (`pressure-guard.js`) are retired — surfacing pressure gauges to the model causes context-anxiety-type degradation per current model guidance. The counters below are still tracked in `memory-index.json` for the user's own diagnosis (`/status`), and `봉인해제` / `UNLEASH` still resets them. The description below documents the counters; enforcement paragraphs are historical.

Crabshell tracks three pressure counters (feedbackPressure.level, feedbackPressure.oscillationCount, tooGoodSkepticism.retryCount) in `.crabshell/memory/memory-index.json`. Together they form a graduated response mechanism that restricts tool access when Claude drifts — either via consecutive negative user feedback or via the assistant's own output patterns (reversals, all-None P/O/G).

Pressure enforcement is Claude-only. Codex does not load `pressure-guard.js` or `sycophancy-guard.js`; however, both hosts use the shared UserPromptSubmit path, so `봉인해제` / `UNLEASH` clears the shared pressure state from either host.

### Three Counters

| Counter | Raised By | Trigger | Reset By |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| feedbackPressure.level (0-3) | inject-rules.js @ UserPromptSubmit | User message matches NEGATIVE_PATTERNS (W021: profanity-only) | Positive-feedback decay (3 clean prompts) · `봉인해제` / `UNLEASH` · TaskCreate tool (L1-L2 only) |
| feedbackPressure.oscillationCount | sycophancy-guard.js @ Stop | Assistant response contains REVERSAL_PATTERNS (e.g., "actually, let me", "다시 생각해보니") — **no user input required** | `봉인해제` / `UNLEASH` |
| tooGoodSkepticism.retryCount | sycophancy-guard.js @ Stop | Assistant response contains a P/O/G table where all Gap cells are None/없음/N/A — **no user input required** | Clean P/O/G (Gap ≠ None) in a later Stop · retryCount > 3 overflow · `봉인해제` / `UNLEASH` (originally BAILOUT, renamed v21.79.0) |

**Note:** Two of the three counters (oscillationCount, tooGoodSkepticism.retryCount) rise from the assistant's own output independent of the user. Use `/crabshell:status` to inspect current values.

### Pressure Levels (feedbackPressure.level)

| Level | Name | Trigger | Effect |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| **L0** | Normal | Default state | All tools available |
| **L1** | Warning | 1 consecutive negative feedback | Warning text injected into context; all tools still available |
| **L2** | Partial Block | 2 consecutive negative feedbacks | 6 primary tools blocked (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write, Edit); conversation-only tools remain |
| **L3** | Full Lockdown | 3+ consecutive negative feedbacks | ALL tools blocked; structured self-diagnosis required (What I did wrong / Why it was wrong / What I will do differently); must resolve through conversation only |

### How It Works

- **Detection:** The `inject-rules.js` hook (UserPromptSubmit) analyzes user prompts for negative feedback signals and updates `feedbackPressure.level` in `memory-index.json`. The `sycophancy-guard.js` hook (Stop) independently analyzes assistant output and updates `feedbackPressure.oscillationCount` and `tooGoodSkepticism.retryCount`.
- **Enforcement:** The `pressure-guard.js` hook (PreToolUse, matcher: `.*`) checks `feedbackPressure.level` before every tool call and blocks accordingly.
- **Decay:** Positive feedback from the user reduces `feedbackPressure.level` naturally. The assistant-side counters decay only on their own reset paths (see table above).
- **Exception:** Operations targeting `.crabshell/` or `.claude/` paths are always allowed, even at L3 (so the plugin can still manage its own state).

### Bailout

If tool access is locked at L2 or L3, the user can type one of these keywords to reset the pressure system:

- **`봉인해제`** (Korean)
- **`UNLEASH`** (English; renamed from `BAILOUT` in v21.79.0 / W021)

Either keyword resets the pressure counters (feedbackPressure.level, consecutiveCount, decayCounter, oscillationCount, lastShownLevel, and tooGoodSkepticism.retryCount) to zero. The reset runs before question/execution intent gating, so the bare keyword and a keyword embedded in a question both work. On reset, stderr logs `[PRESSURE BAILOUT: reset all 3 counters]` (internal label retained for backward log-compatibility).

This is the **only** way to immediately escape L2/L3 without waiting for natural decay. When you're stuck at L2/L3, Claude will inform you about these keywords.

**Note:** As of v21.77.0, the bailout keyword (then `BAILOUT`, since renamed `UNLEASH` in v21.79.0) also resets `tooGoodSkepticism.retryCount` (previously only `feedbackPressure.*` was reset).

## CLAUDE.md Integration

The plugin automatically manages a rules section in your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## CRITICAL RULES (Core Principles Alignment)
...plugin-managed rules (SCOPE DEFINITIONS, UNDERSTANDING-FIRST, VERIFICATION-FIRST, etc.)...
---Add your project-specific rules below this line---

- Your project rule 1
- Your project rule 2
```

- **Above the line**: Auto-managed by the plugin. Updated every prompt via `syncRulesToClaudeMd()`. Contains PRINCIPLES, SCOPE DEFINITIONS, UNDERSTANDING-FIRST, VERIFICATION-FIRST, PROBLEM-SOLVING PRINCIPLES, INTERFERENCE PATTERNS, REQUIREMENTS, VIOLATIONS, and ADDITIONAL RULES.
- **Below the line**: Your project-specific content. The plugin never modifies anything below this marker.
- **Orchestration defaults**: the auto-managed rules and compressed checklist carry the same internal task contract, bounded delegation, and parent-owned verification defaults. There is no separate always-loaded agent-count rules file in this repository.

### Dual Injection

The plugin uses two injection mechanisms:
1. **CLAUDE.md sync**: Full rules written to the file on disk (persists across sessions, visible to you)
2. **COMPRESSED_CHECKLIST**: A condensed reminder injected into Claude's context every prompt via the `UserPromptSubmit` hook (not written to disk, reduces token usage by ~77% vs. full rules)

---

## Configuration

`.crabshell/memory/config.json` (per-project) or `~/.crabshell/config.json` (global):

```json
{
  "saveInterval": 15,
  "keepRaw": false,
  "rulesInjectionFrequency": 1,
  "quietStop": true,
  "memoryRotation": {
    "thresholdTokens": 25000,
    "carryoverTokens": 2500
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `saveInterval` | 15 | Tool uses before auto-save triggers |
| `keepRaw` | false | Keep `.raw.jsonl` files after L1 conversion |
| `rulesInjectionFrequency` | 1 | Inject rules every N prompts (1 = every prompt) |
| `quietStop` | true | Brief session-end message instead of verbose instructions |
| `memoryRotation.thresholdTokens` | 25000 | Token threshold for logbook.md rotation (with 0.95 safety margin) |
| `memoryRotation.carryoverTokens` | 2500 | Tokens to keep as carryover after rotation (with 0.95 safety margin) |
| `webGuard` | "block" | Web guard mode: `block` (WebFetch blocked, WebSearch blocked only when a search MCP is configured), `warn` (never blocks, injects verification warnings), `off` (guard disabled) (v21.114.0) |

### Orchestration Defaults

The eight-field task contract, risk boundary for user questions, bounded worker prompt, and parent-owned completion rule are product defaults rather than per-project settings. They are centralized in `scripts/shared-context.js` and `scripts/core/orchestration-policy.js`; changing memory configuration does not weaken them. The live regression corpus can be run with `node scripts/run-orchestration-corpus.js --live --json` in a disposable fixture.

### Declaring verification commands

Parent evidence recognizes commands declared in `.crabshell/verification/manifest.json` (`tools` or non-manual `entries`) and the package's `scripts.test` command chain. Declare custom check names there instead of relying on a filename containing `test`. A single invocation must match; compound shell commands and printed command names are not accepted as check identity. Entry assertions also apply; forbidden-change assertions require the declared runner because a post-tool event cannot reconstruct their before-state.

Claude's captured successful `PostToolUse` Bash object has no exit-code field. An explicit code overrides success inference; failure, interruption, and running indicators prevent it. Claude failures arrive as a top-level `error` plus `is_interrupt`. The captured Codex CLI PostToolUse contains only output text: `host-tool-result.js` obtains an explicit `exit_code` from the matching completed command in its transcript. Session, turn, command ID and cwd must agree; missing or conflicting evidence stays unconfirmed. Captures and provenance are under `scripts/fixtures/hook-payloads/native/`.

Project content identity excludes `.git`, `.crabshell`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, and symlinks, then includes the verification manifest and runner separately. It does not use `.gitignore`. The same result reuses its computed value, but later events and Stop check contents again; large-project latency remains an evaluation item.

### Hook Input Capture and Recovery

Available since v21.123.0. Set
`CRABSHELL_HOOK_CAPTURE_DIR=.crabshell/hook-captures` when reproducing a host payload
issue. Capture is off by default. It saves raw stdin and separate host/event/hash
metadata only inside the project's `.crabshell`; failures leave the hook running.
Captured input can contain command output or prompts. Keep it local and select only
the needed fixture before sharing. `HOOK_DATA` and timed-out input are labeled
separately from complete stdin. See [capture procedure](scripts/fixtures/hook-payloads/CAPTURE.md).

The existing completion state includes a bounded recovery record: initial/latest
request excerpts, last observed check and unfinished/paused status. SessionStart and
compaction read it without creating fresh task permission. An explicit stop or a
supported interrupt invalidates earlier success and prevents late results from
resuming work. A new explicit action can resume, followed by a fresh check. Missing
events after forced process termination cannot guarantee saving.

### Prepared Delta Finalization

Claude's `memory-delta` skill uses `append-memory.js --prepare-delta` before summary
generation. Its returned input stays fixed while later extraction uses a separate
queue. If the host permits the available summarizer, it runs in the foreground;
one `--finalize-delta --job-id=... --summary-file=...` command then saves the summary,
advances only the captured input cutoff and cleans its own temporary files. Failed
or unavailable summarization leaves input pending. Do not manually delete the new
queue or run legacy cleanup on an active prepared job. Codex gets a pending notice
because the automatic summarizer skills are not bundled. Legacy explicit summary
append remains available when no prepared job exists. Retry protection covers a
completed append followed by a failed metadata write; arbitrary partial disk writes
or storage loss are not promised to be atomic.

### Codex Plugin Configuration

- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` is the repo-scoped native marketplace source.
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` explicitly points to `codex-skills/` and `hooks/codex-hooks.json`.
- Both `command` and `commandWindows` entries use the same Node Promise fail-open boundary; shell-independent `PLUGIN_ROOT` lookup, missing-module failure, and rejected adapters are covered by the Windows hook regression.
- Codex stores installed plugin material under its plugin cache and writable runtime data under `plugins/data/<plugin>-<marketplace>` inside `CODEX_HOME`; plugin source files are not used as writable state.
- Hook definitions are not runnable until Codex records trust for their current hash. Any definition change produces `modified` until reviewed again.
- Run `crabshell:status` for live Claude/Codex installed, activated, trusted, behavior-verified, degraded, drifted, and unsupported results. It uses current CLI/plugin/cache/hook observations, not a Crabshell-maintained version compatibility table; Codex app remains a separate row.

### lock-contention.json — F-4 Instrumentation State

`.crabshell/memory/lock-contention.json`. Per-lock object (keyed by lock filename), 9 fields: `acquireCount`, `releaseCount`, `contendedCount`, `totalWaitMs`, `totalHeldMs`, `maxWaitMs`, `maxHeldMs`, `lastAcquiredPid`, `lastUpdatedAt`; top-level `measurementWindowStart` ISO marker. F-4 lock contention measurement → F-3 ratification. Additive top-level keys safe (`_recordContention` reads `state[lockName]` only). **Related:** `### _recordContention`.

### _recordContention — Lock Hold/Wait Measurement

`scripts/utils.js` L145-181. Three call sites (D107 D4): `acquireIndexLock` success L190, failure L205, `releaseIndexLock` L221. Unprotected `writeJson` avoids recursive-lock deadlock (L139-141). Race: concurrent writes may drop increments → conservative undercount (real ≥ measured); cycle 7+ ratification factors margin. Fail-open. **Related:** `### lock-contention.json`.

## Setting Project Information

Set information you want Claude to know at the start of every session.

Both hosts use `.crabshell/project.md`. The supported `counter.js memory-set/get/list` commands use that same path. When only `.crabshell/memory/project.md` exists, the reader copies it to the root path while preserving the old file. If both exist, the root file wins; explicit replacement writes a `project.md.bak` backup first.

**Option 1: Ask Claude (Recommended)**
> "Save this to project.md: This is a Next.js 14 app with TypeScript and Prisma."

**Option 2: Edit files directly**
```bash
echo "Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Prisma" > .crabshell/project.md
```

## Obsidian Integration (Optional)

Crabshell supports using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as a visual interface for your `.crabshell/` documents. This is entirely opt-in — no configuration required to use Crabshell without Obsidian.

### How to Enable

Open your project's `.crabshell/` folder as an Obsidian vault:

1. Open Obsidian → "Open folder as vault"
2. Select `[your-project]/.crabshell/`

All D/P/T/I/W documents will be visible and navigable with graph view and backlinks.

### What You Get

**YAML Frontmatter** — every new D/P/T/I/W document includes a 6-field header:

```yaml
---
id: D001
type: discussion
status: open
created: 2026-04-12
project: my-project
tags: [crabshell, discussion]
---
```

**Wikilinks** — tickets reference their parent plans, plans reference their discussion:

```markdown
## Context
Parent plan: [[P001]]
Discussion: [[D094]]
```

These wikilinks appear as edges in Obsidian's graph view, letting you see the full decision → plan → ticket chain visually.

### Retroactive Migration

To add frontmatter and wikilinks to existing documents, run:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-obsidian.js --project-dir=PATH [--dry-run] [--backup]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project-dir=PATH` | Path to the project root (the folder containing `.crabshell/`) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without writing any files |
| `--backup` | Create `.bak` backups before modifying each file |

**Example:**

```bash
# Preview what would change
node scripts/migrate-obsidian.js --project-dir=/my/project --dry-run

# Run with backups
node scripts/migrate-obsidian.js --project-dir=/my/project --backup
```

The script processes all documents under `.crabshell/discussion/`, `.crabshell/plan/`, `.crabshell/ticket/`, `.crabshell/investigation/`, and `.crabshell/worklog/`. Documents that already have frontmatter are skipped.

## Troubleshooting

### Memory Not Loading
1. Check `.crabshell/memory/` folder exists
2. Check `logbook.md` file exists
3. Run `/crabshell:load-memory`

### Auto-save Not Triggering
1. Check counter in `.crabshell/memory/counter.json`
2. Ask Claude: "Reset the memory counter"

### L1 Files Taking Too Much Space
Ask Claude: "Remove duplicate L1 files"

L1 files are deduplicated automatically when created, but manual cleanup may sometimes be needed.

### Rules Not Being Injected
1. Check that `CLAUDE.md` exists in your project root
2. Look for the `## CRITICAL RULES (Core Principles Alignment)` marker
3. Check `.crabshell/memory/logs/inject-debug.log` for errors

## Doc Debt

The following cycle 5 (D107) features were shipped in v21.88.0 but their dedicated USER-MANUAL.md sections are pending — explicit deferral per P149_T001 D1 directive (path b) to avoid cycle 7 scope creep and the v21.83.0 ARCHITECTURE.md backfill class bug (commit `de04944`). Cycle 8+ doc cycle to write the proper sections.

| # | Feature | Source | What it does | Section it belongs to | Status |
|---|---------|--------|--------------|-----------------------|--------|
| 1 | Response skeleton lineage | `scripts/inject-rules.js` / `scripts/core/first-turn-context.js` / release history | Former 5-field, 7-field, and caveman-style 3-field designs remain retired; v21.108.0 restores a concise three-field response ending from the shared host-neutral core. | [Internal Task Contract and Shared Response Ending](#internal-task-contract-and-shared-response-ending) | Restored in v21.108.0 without restoring the retired verifier or caveman presentation. |
| 2 | ~~`ANTI_PATTERNS_INLINE`~~ | ~~`scripts/inject-rules.js`~~ | **Removed in v21.91.0** (D108/I069). Per-turn inline injection of 9 PROHIBITED + 4 AVOID patterns (~1,701 B). Current coverage comes from the auto-managed rules, parent-owned verification, and active safety guards; the later verifier fallback was retired in v21.106.0. | N/A | Removed |
| 3 | `.crabshell/memory/lock-contention.json` | F-4 instrumentation state file (NEW) | Per-lock metrics file: `acquireCount`, `releaseCount`, `contendedCount`, `totalWaitMs`, `totalHeldMs`, `maxWaitMs`, `maxHeldMs`, `lastAcquiredPid`, `lastUpdatedAt`, plus top-level `measurementWindowStart` ISO marker (cycle 6). Powers F-3 path-choice ratification analysis. | Configuration §Memory Files | Done — section: `### lock-contention.json` (under `## Configuration`) |
| 4 | `_recordContention` (utils.js F-4 instrumentation) | `scripts/utils.js` (~47 lines, called from inside `acquireIndexLock` / `releaseIndexLock`) | Lock-contention measurement helper. Intentionally uses unprotected `writeJson` to avoid recursive lock acquisition (deadlock prevention) — accepts conservative undercount bias as a documented trade-off. | Hooks/Guards §Lock Contention Measurement | Done — section: `### _recordContention` (under `## Configuration`) |

This table is a historical documentation ledger. Current behavior is defined by the active source and sections linked above; retired verifier proposals are not implementation specifications.
