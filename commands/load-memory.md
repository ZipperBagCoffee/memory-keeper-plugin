description: Load and summarize recent session memories
---

Read session files from ~/.claude/memory-keeper/sessions/

1. Find files matching current project name (priority)
2. Also check recent sessions from other projects
3. Summarize what was worked on, pending TODOs, key decisions

Provide a brief context restoration - just enough to continue where we left off.
