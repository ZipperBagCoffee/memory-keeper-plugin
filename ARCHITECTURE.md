# Crabshell Architecture (v21.123.0)

## Overview

Crabshell is a dual-runtime Claude Code/Codex plugin. Both hosts use native hook manifests backed by shared first-turn, memory, workflow, compaction, subagent, command-observation, and parent-completion cores. Claude Code retains automatic SessionEnd capture, pressure telemetry, and deterministic guards; behavioral pressure/sycophancy/scope hooks are unwired. Codex uses synchronous native lifecycle/Interrupt events and explicit memory/document skills. Both runtimes share `.crabshell/` storage without launching or requiring each other. Version 21.123.0 adds native failure/capture/finalization/recovery handling.

## Core Philosophy

### Understanding-First
Before changing code, identify the user's scope and inspect named references. Resolve routine choices from evidence; ask only when a material unresolved choice requires user input. A polite request to act authorizes that scoped work. A status question does not discard an already authorized task, and an explicit stop takes precedence.

### Verification-First
Before claiming any result verified, Claude must:
1. **Predict** — write expected observation BEFORE looking
2. **Execute** — run code, trigger behavior, use tools
3. **Compare** — prediction vs observation; the gap is where findings live

Every verification item requires a P/O/G (Prediction/Observation/Gap) check. The chat report is `"M of N passed"` plus failed items — no table, no passing-item list, no raw observations (v21.115.0/.1, I085 — screen output only, verification depth unchanged). "File contains X" is never verification. "Can verify but didn't" is a violation.

Observation resolution levels (v21.2.0): L1 (direct execution) > L2 (indirect execution) > L3 (structural check) > L4 (claim without evidence, prohibited). L3 alone is insufficient when L1 is possible.

### SCOPE DEFINITIONS
The plugin's RULES section includes Scope Definitions that reframe Claude's built-in system prompt directives (conciseness, efficiency, directness) so they do not conflict with verification requirements:
- "Be concise" applies to communication style, not verification steps
- "Execute immediately" means execute the understanding step immediately
- "Don't overdo it" — skipping verification is underdoing it
- "Simplest approach" — simplest VALID approach; reading is not verifying

### PROBLEM-SOLVING PRINCIPLES
Two meta-principles guide Claude's approach to obstacles:
- **Constraint Reporting**: When hitting a limitation, report the constraint clearly — never recommend surrendering or abandoning the goal. The user decides whether to change direction.
- **Cross-Domain Translation**: Before substituting a same-domain tool, characterize the problem's abstract structure first. This enables finding solutions from adjacent domains that may fit better.

### Dual Injection Optimization
- **CLAUDE.md** (session start): Full RULES text (~940 tokens, 3.8KB measured v21.113.0 — compressed from ~2,530 tokens in I083 R3) synced via `syncRulesToClaudeMd()` with marker-based replacement
- **additionalContext** (every prompt): compact turn contract + 4-line Rules Quick-Check (~550 tokens total including Project Concept, measured v21.113.0 — down from ~1,220) — per-response 3-field ending and pressure texts retired
- **Error fallback**: FIRST_TURN_RULES injected via additionalContext only when the normal path throws an exception

                +----------------------- native Codex hook output ------------------------+
```

- The explicit manifest hook path is a runtime boundary: Codex does not default-discover Claude's `hooks/hooks.json`.
- Codex exposes synchronous events: `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop`, and `Interrupt`.
- Every Codex hook command resolves its adapter inside a Promise fail-open boundary; synchronous module-load errors and rejected adapter `main()` calls are absorbed with exit 0.
- SessionStart reads shared memory/workflow context; `getProjectMemoryPath()` may copy a legacy-only description into `.crabshell/project.md` without deleting or overwriting existing files. Explicit memory and document skills execute from installed launchers against the active project. Document launchers require absolute `--project-dir`. Claude's automatic SessionEnd transcript/delta save remains Claude-only.
- One shared completion state owner requires parent-executed command evidence after a child claim, rejects ambiguous/false-done evidence, and bounds identical automatic failures. Claude retains the doc-watchdog Stop check behind `completion-controller.js`; the behavioral sycophancy/scope checks are unwired. Codex emits the native block decision through its adapter.
- Pressure telemetry remains; behavioral pressure/sycophancy/scope hooks, fixed-count, role-collapse, and behavior-verifier surfaces remain retired from both runtimes.
- `codex-doctor.js` probes both CLIs and derives installed, activated, trusted, behavior-verified, degraded, drifted, and unsupported states. Codex desktop app remains a separate unexercised row.
- `scripts/install-codex.js` remains a legacy/development bridge and is not part of the native default path.

### Verification evidence and content identity (v21.123.0)

`command-observation.js` matches a single parsed invocation against project manifest declarations or package test configuration. It rejects command-name lookalikes and compound shell invocations, interprets explicit failure/running/interruption signals, and checks applicable entry assertions. Claude's captured successful PostToolUse object can imply exit zero when no explicit code exists; Codex requires explicit result codes. Fixture provenance is kept under `scripts/fixtures/hook-payloads/`.

Both completion adapters receive `Bash|Write|Edit`; the Codex adapter normalizes `cmd` to `command`. Content changes invalidate parent evidence. A result event reuses one source fingerprint for invalidation and replacement; future events and Stop rescan. The fingerprint excludes `.git`, `.crabshell`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, and symlinks, then includes the verification manifest and runner separately. It does not follow `.gitignore` or provide an atomic snapshot of concurrent external writes.

Claude `PostToolUseFailure` is wired to both verification-state and parent-evidence recording. Its captured failure is a top-level `error` with `is_interrupt`; success remains a different envelope. Codex `PostToolUse.tool_response` is output text in the captured CLI. `host-tool-result.js` reads a bounded transcript tail and requires a matching command ID, session, turn and project cwd before using `exit_code`. Unsupported/missing/ambiguous records remain inconclusive.

`check-history.js` distinguishes a duplicate notification from a new invocation, preserves independent failed checks, and rejects late superseded results. `state-lock.js` serializes state writes. An ordinary non-check shell event does not scan all source files. Content hashes, not size/mtime, still govern decisive validation. Codex `Interrupt`, Claude interruption results and recognized explicit stop requests suspend owned work and invalidate test success. The bounded `recovery` projection in existing completion state is read at SessionStart and compaction; it carries excerpts and historical evidence, never fresh permission or proof of current success. No new SessionEnd summarization is required.

## Memory Hierarchy (v13.0.0+)

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  L1: Raw Session Transcripts                                              |
|  - sessions/*.l1.jsonl (refined conversation logs)                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  L2: Rolling Memory (auto-rotates at 23,750 tokens)                       |
|  - logbook.md (active, grows with each session)                           |
|  - logbook_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md (archived when rotated)                      |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  L3: Compressed Summaries (Haiku-generated JSON)                          |
|  - logbook_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.summary.json                                    |
|    (themes, keyDecisions, issues, overallSummary)                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Hook Flow

```
1. SessionStart
   └─> load-memory.js
       ├─> Read logbook.md + summaries + project files through core/memory-context.js
       ├─> Recover current active D/P/T/W context through core/workflow-context.js
       └─> Return native SessionStart context without project/plugin-data writes

2. UserPromptSubmit (every prompt)
   └─> inject-rules.js
       ├─> Classify question vs execution through core/turn-intent.js
       ├─> Explicit 봉인해제 / UNLEASH: reset and persist pressure before the intent gate
       ├─> Other questions: inject read-only shared contract, perform no lifecycle writes
       ├─> First execution prompt: cleanup/reset + syncRulesToClaudeMd() + MEMORY.md warning
       ├─> Inject COMPRESSED_CHECKLIST (~380 tokens measured) via additionalContext
       │   (Full RULES ~2,530 tokens only on error fallback)
       ├─> Inject Project Concept (first 20 lines of project.md, max 1000 chars) via additionalContext
       ├─> Inject prompt-aware memory snippets (keyword-match top 3 sections)
       ├─> Check for pending rotation (summaryGenerated: false)
       │   └─> If yes: Inject ROTATION_INSTRUCTION → Claude executes memory-rotate skill
       ├─> Check for active regressing session (regressing-state.json)
       │   └─> If yes: Inject phase-specific reminder (MANDATORY SKILL TOOL CALL)
       ├─> Check ticket statuses for active regressing (ticket/INDEX.md) — v21.12.0
       │   └─> If todo/in-progress tickets: Inject warning reminder
       ├─> Check for emergency stop keywords → replace entire context
       └─> Output indicator: [rules injected], [rules + rotation pending], [REGRESSING ACTIVE]
           (Claude pending notices use available foreground summarizers; host delegation rules win. Codex emits a pending notice without invoking missing skills.)

3. PreToolUse — multiple guards (ordered: cheapest first)
   ├─> path-guard.js (Read|Grep|Glob|Bash|Write|Edit) — v19.31.0+
   │   ├─> Block operations targeting wrong .crabshell/ path
   │   ├─> Block Edit on memory/logbook.md — append-only enforcement (v20.3.0)
   │   └─> Block Write shrink on logbook.md — line count decrease detection (v20.6.0)
   ├─> regressing-guard.js (Write|Edit) — v19.23.0+

## Skills Architecture

### Document Skills (D/P/T/I/W)
Five skills manage append-only documents stored in `.crabshell/` (gitignored):

| Skill | Document Type | Code | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|------|---------|
| discussing | Discussion | D001, D002... | Explore decisions, capture context |
| planning | Plan | P001, P002... | Detailed execution plans |
| ticketing | Ticket | P001_T001... | Atomic work units (child of Plan) |
| investigating | Investigation | I001, I002... | Independent research/analysis |
| (retired: light-workflow, v21.112.0) | Worklog | W001, W002... | Legacy worklog history — read-only; restart context still honors in-flight W docs |

Document hierarchy: D -> P -> T (Discussion spawns Plans, Plans spawn Tickets). Investigations and Worklogs are independent.

Each document type has an INDEX.md for tracking. Status cascades upward on completion (ticket verified -> plan closes -> discussion closes).

### Workflow Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| hotfix | Directly-performed one-pass work recorded in H documents (Problem/Fix/Verification). Replaced light-workflow in v21.112.0 (D113). |
| lint | Obsidian document linter — 5 checks (orphans, broken wikilinks, stale status, missing frontmatter, INDEX inconsistencies). |
| search-docs | BM25 full-text search across D/P/T/I/W documents with field boosting (title 3x, tags 2x, id 1.5x). |
| regressing | Iterative D->P->T loop. Each cycle targets the current verified gap; an explicit user count is a cap, not a partition target. |
| verifying | Create/run project-specific verification tools. Invoked as procedural step in ticketing/regressing. |

### Memory Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| save-memory | Manual memory save trigger |
| load-memory | Rebuild full context after compaction/restart |
| search-memory | L1/L2/L3 search (--deep for L1 transcripts) |
| clear-memory | Cleanup memory files |
| memory-autosave | Auto-trigger memory save at counter threshold |
| memory-delta | Prepare fixed queued input, foreground summary, then one finalize command |
| memory-rotate | Auto-trigger L3 summary generation after rotation |

### Agent Structure
The parent agent owns the end-to-end decision path:

```
internal task contract
        |
        v
inspect -> implement -> direct behavioral verification -> report
        |                         ^
        +-- optional workers -----+
            (bounded evidence; no completion authority)
```

The internal contract has eight fields: `original_request`, `required_outcomes`, `non_goals`, `named_references`, `allowed_changes`, `forbidden_side_effects`, `observable_success`, and `blocking_unknowns`. The parent may delegate bounded work when it helps, but it retains named-reference resolution, diff inspection, decisive execution, side-effect checks, and completion authority. Explore/review workers are read-only and workers do not fan out.

Regressing retains document-cycle continuation but has no parallel-worker count or parent-write delegation gate. Light-workflow also uses risk-based optional delegation without fixed agent counts or Work/Review pairing.

## Scripts Reference

| Script | Hook | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `find-node.sh` | (fallback utility) | Cross-platform Node.js locator retained for fallback use; direct hooks run `node` from `hooks.json` in v21.99.3 |
| `load-memory.js` | SessionStart | Load memory hierarchy, MEMORY.md warning |
| `inject-rules.js` | UserPromptSubmit | Dual injection (CLAUDE.md + additionalContext), Claude-host-only Codex delegation guidance, intent-independent pressure bailout, delta/rotation/regressing detection |
| `counter.js` | PostToolUse, SessionEnd | Main engine: counter, L1 creation, rotation, regressing phase detection |
| `regressing-guard.js` | PreToolUse (Write\|Edit) | Block direct plan/ticket writes during active regressing; force Skill tool; validate P doc agent sections before ticketing (v21.41.0) |
| `docs-guard.js` | PreToolUse (Write\|Edit) | Block writes to .crabshell/ D/P/T/I/H subdirectories without active skill flag |
| `log-guard.js` | PreToolUse (Write\|Edit) | Block INDEX.md terminal status without document log entries; block tickets with "(pending)" result sections; block cycle docs without previous cycle logs |
| `verify-guard.js` | PreToolUse (Write\|Edit) | Hybrid: Edit always enforces verification; Write enforces only for existing files (new file creation skips). Block Final Verification without /verifying run; require behavioral AC in manifest |
| `pressure-guard.js` | (unwired v21.113.0 — I083 R4) | Retired from PreToolUse; pressure counters remain telemetry-only. Script kept on disk for re-wiring if regression observed |
| `path-guard.js` | PreToolUse (Read\|Grep\|Glob\|Bash\|Write\|Edit) | Block wrong .crabshell/ path; shell var resolution (fail-closed for .crabshell/ v21.8.0); block Edit on logbook.md; block Write shrink on logbook.md (v20.6.0) |
| `web-guard.js` | PreToolUse (WebFetch\|WebSearch) | Block WebFetch (small-model summarization, lossy by design) with URL-substituted raw-fetch redirect (trafilatura → r.jina.ai → curl); block WebSearch only when a search MCP is configured in ~/.claude.json or .mcp.json, else allow with snippet-verification warning; modes block/warn/off via `webGuard` config (v21.114.0, I084) |
| `core/path-policy.js` | shared library | Host-neutral memory path decisions used by Claude and Codex wrappers |
| `core/first-turn-context.js`, `core/memory-context.js`, `core/workflow-context.js` | shared libraries | Shared compact turn contract, memory with preserving legacy-description copy, and restart-safe workflow context |
| `core/compaction-context.js`, `core/subagent-context.js` | shared libraries | Recovery context and bounded task-specific child context for both hosts |
| `core/command-observation.js`, `core/completion-control.js` | shared libraries | Declared checks and host-specific results; current-content parent evidence with one fingerprint per result event |
| `core/support-state.js` | shared library | Derive the seven live doctor states without a version compatibility table |
| `adapters/codex/*` | Codex native lifecycle | Normalize native lifecycle/Interrupt payloads and emit Codex-native results without Claude exit-code semantics |
| `completion-controller.js` | Claude Stop/SubagentStop/PostToolUse | Single completion owner that retains existing Claude Stop validators |
| `codex-doctor.js` | shared status skill | Query live Claude/Codex CLI, plugin/cache, skills, hook trust/hash, direct behavior, degradation, and drift; keep Codex app separate |
| `codex-memory.js` | Codex skills | Explicit load/save/search/status against the active project's shared `.crabshell/` store |
| `core/orchestration-policy.js` | shared library | Build the 8-field task contract, apply question boundaries, resolve named references, and evaluate parent-owned completion evidence |
| `run-orchestration-corpus.js` | regression CLI | Run baseline/current Codex conversation fixtures, reference perturbation, false-done rejection, and workspace side-effect checks |
| `verify-cross-runtime.js` | regression CLI | Sequential shared-behavior and negative-mutation entry; fail-open suite runs alone and last |
| `_test-cross-platform-native-hosts.js` | release smoke | Isolated Windows/Linux Claude Code CLI and Codex CLI install/activation matrix; app reported separately |
| `skills/verifying/scripts/run-verify.js` | verification source | Canonical portable schema-v2 runner: repo-relative commands, structured assertions, and forbidden-path snapshots |
| `.crabshell/verification/run-verify.js` | generated project runner | Byte-equivalent generated runner consumed by `verify-guard.js`; stdout text is diagnostic, not a pass oracle |
| `sycophancy-guard.js` | (unwired v21.113.0 — I083 R5) | Retired from PreToolUse and Stop dispatch; anti-sycophancy training in Sonnet 4.5+ models replaced the prompt/hook layer. Script kept on disk |
| `scope-guard.js` | (unwired v21.113.0 — I083 R5) | Retired from Stop dispatch; scope preservation lives as a short principle in RULES. Script kept on disk |
| `regressing-loop-guard.js` | retained compatibility source | Legacy count-independent continuation helper retained for regression coverage; no longer a direct manifest Stop owner. Regressing continuation is goal-driven (v21.110.0): the regressing skill emits a `/goal` handoff for host goal mode, and `completion-controller.js` keeps bounded continuation on execution-authorized turns |
| `skill-tracker.js` | PostToolUse (Skill) | Set skill-active flag on Skill tool calls (TTL-based, 5min expiry) |
| `regressing-state.js` | (library) | Phase tracker: getState, buildReminder, detectSkillCall, advancePhase |
| `extract-delta.js` | (library) | L1 delta extraction, timestamp watermarks, temp file management |
| `memory-rotation.js` | (library) | Token-based rotation: archive at 23,750 tokens, 2,375 token carryover |
| `search.js` | (library) | Multi-layer L1/L2/L3 search |
| `constants.js` | (library) | Centralized thresholds, file paths, regressing state file path |
| `utils.js` | (library) | Shared utilities: readJsonOrDefault, readIndexSafe, writeJson, getProjectDir |
| `init.js` | (library) | Project initialization, index preservation on parse error |
| `transcript-utils.js` | (library) | Shared stdin/transcript utilities: readStdin, findTranscriptPath, encodeProjectPath, normalizePath |
| `refine-raw.js` | (library) | raw.jsonl -> l1.jsonl conversion (async + sync with optional byte offset) |
| `legacy-migration.js` | (library) | Split oversized memory files |

## Configuration Constants (constants.js)

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| ROTATION_THRESHOLD_TOKENS | 23750 | Effective rotation threshold (25000 * 0.95) |
| CARRYOVER_TOKENS | 2375 | Carryover on rotation (2500 * 0.95) |
| MEMORY_DIR | memory | Memory storage directory |
| SESSIONS_DIR | sessions | Session storage directory |
| INDEX_FILE | memory-index.json | Rotation tracking + delta state |
| COUNTER_FILE | counter.json | PostToolUse counter (separated from index) |
| MEMORY_FILE | logbook.md | Active memory file |
| REGRESSING_STATE_FILE | regressing-state.json | Regressing cycle tracker |
| SKILL_ACTIVE_FILE | skill-active.json | TTL-based skill flag for docs-guard/verify-guard |
| DELTA_JOBS_DIR | delta-jobs | Fixed memory inputs and per-attempt summaries |
| DELTA_SUMMARY_FILE | delta_summary_temp.txt | Legacy standalone summary input |

## Memory Rotation Flow

Delta input uses a separate prepare/finalize path: `append-memory.js --prepare-delta`
moves the queue into `delta-jobs/<jobId>/input.txt`, while new extraction appends to a
new queue. The available summarizer writes the returned attempt-specific summary.
`--finalize-delta --job-id=... --summary-file=...` appends, advances the captured L1
cutoff, clears flags and cleans only its own input/summary files under index/rotation
locks. A committed job marker prevents duplicate completed appends on retry. Legacy
append remains supported when no prepared job is active. This does not promise
atomic recovery from arbitrary partial disk writes or loss of the underlying disk.

## memory-index.json Structure

```json
{
  "version": 1,

  "rotatedFiles": [
    {
      "file": "logbook_20260113_120000.md",

  "deltaCreatedAtMemoryMtime": 1234567890123.456
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| lastMemoryUpdateTs | ISO timestamp of last processed L1 entry (for delta extraction) |
| deltaCreatedAtMemoryMtime | logbook.md mtime when delta was created (for cleanup validation) |
| deltaReady | Flag: true when delta_temp.txt is ready for processing |
| deltaJob | Active fixed input ID/hash/cutoff and preparing/ready/appending/appended/complete state |
| pendingLastProcessedTs | Latest retained L1 cutoff; finalization advances only its captured cutoff and preserves newer queued input |
| lastL1TranscriptMtime | Transcript file mtime at last L1 creation (skip redundant L1 creation) |
| lastL1TranscriptOffset | Byte offset into transcript file after last L1 creation (incremental reads, v21.10.0) |
| feedbackPressure | Pressure system state: `level` (0-3), `consecutiveCount`, `oscillationCount`, `decayCounter`, `lastShownLevel`, `lastDetectedAt` — RMW under index lock |
| tooGoodSkepticism | Sycophancy guard "too good" P/O/G all-None retry counter: `retryCount` |

### counter.json Structure (v20.5.0)

```json
{
  "counter": 0
}
```

Separated from memory-index.json to eliminate Write race condition during delta processing. counter.js writes this on every PostToolUse; memory-index.json is now only written during rotation/delta operations.

## L3 Summary Structure

```json

  "sourceFile": "logbook_20260113_120000.md",
  "generatedAt": "2026-01-13T12:05:00.000Z",
  "themes": [

  "overallSummary": "This period focused on authentication system..."
}
```

## Known Limitations

### Stop Hook Text Block Gap
- The Stop hook's `stop_response` field contains only the **last text block** of multi-block responses. When Claude produces text, then calls a tool, then produces more text, only the final text block is visible to the Stop hook.
- **Impact on sycophancy detection**: Sycophancy patterns in early text blocks (before tool calls) are invisible to the Stop hook. A response that agrees without evidence in block 1, calls Write in block 2, and writes a summary in block 3 would only have block 3 checked by the Stop hook.
- **Partial mitigation**: The PreToolUse layer of `sycophancy-guard.js` parses mid-turn transcript text before each Write|Edit call. This catches sycophancy that precedes file writes, but only for Write|Edit — not for Read, Grep, Glob, or Bash tool calls.
- **Remaining gap**: If Claude agrees without evidence and then uses Read/Grep/Glob/Bash (but not Write/Edit), neither the Stop hook nor the PreToolUse guard catches the sycophancy. Expanding PreToolUse to check transcript text for all tool types is a potential future mitigation.

### Guard Consolidation (IA-6 Analysis)
The 4 PreToolUse Write|Edit guards (regressing-guard, docs-guard, log-guard, verify-guard) remain separate. Consolidation was analyzed and rejected for safety:
- **Independent fail-open isolation**: Each guard catches errors and exits 0 independently. A merged script's crash in one guard's logic would silently disable all guards.
- **Different dependencies**: regressing-state.json, skill-active.json, run-verify.js + manifest.json, and transcript files respectively. A dependency failure in one should not affect others.
- **Different complexity profiles**: 60 lines (regressing) vs 497 lines (sycophancy). Merging makes simple guards harder to reason about.
- **Concurrent execution**: Separate processes run in parallel via hook system, which is faster than sequential checks in one process.

## Version History

| Version | Key Changes |
|---------|-------------|
| 21.123.0 | Native failure/Interrupt evidence, bound Codex transcript results, ordered check state, prepared delta finalization and bounded recovery. |
| 21.122.0 | Declared-check evidence, captured host result handling, edit invalidation with one scan per result, shared project-description resolution, and portable Codex document launchers. |
| 21.121.0 | feat: D116 — pipeline wiring probe (`check-pipeline-wiring.js`) validates a parent-approved hook/trigger/agent contract against the source and fails on unclassified hops; optional `arch-explorer` map is documentation only. |
| 21.120.0 | feat: closing-verdict rule — per-item done/in-progress/not-started state closes long output, matching CLI end-first reading. |
| 21.119.0 | feat: term-discipline decision rule and banter-directive restore in the injected Simple Communication rule and per-turn checklist. |
| 21.118.0 | feat: spoken-register clause in the injected Simple Communication rule and per-turn checklist — style persists via injection, not session promises. |
| 21.117.0 | feat: D115 — verification method injected every turn (match method to claim / assert what survives the release / classify a failure before editing), closing the gap for turns that never load the verifying skill. Pure-directive form; mutation-sensitivity left to the skill's high-risk path. |
| 21.116.0 | feat: D114/I086 — verifying skill teaches contract-based verification instead of copied expected values; claim-type gate, value-stability gate, failing-entry classification, discovery over enumeration. Deciding axis established as "was a value copied", not runtime-vs-static. |
| 21.115.1 | fix: P/O/G rule drops the invented document destination — the chat report is `"M of N passed"` + failures and the table is simply not printed. |
| 21.115.0 | feat: I085 response-format replacement — injected `RULES` Simple Communication becomes a four-slot response contract with a keep-vs-cut list and an accuracy-over-brevity precedence clause; the P/O/G table moves from chat to the D/P/T/I/H document (chat keeps `"M of N passed"` + failures); failure reporting narrows to blocked tasks. COMPRESSED_CHECKLIST synced. No new guard hook — counting belongs in a post-hoc checker, not a runtime block (v21.113.0 precedent). |
| 21.114.0 | feat: I084 web-guard — PreToolUse guard on WebFetch/WebSearch (WebFetch blocked with raw-fetch redirect; WebSearch conditionally blocked only when a search MCP exists, else warn-through); investigating skill Work Agent 1 re-anchored to raw-source ladder (search MCP → snippets-as-pointers, trafilatura → r.jina.ai → curl). |
| 21.113.2 | fix: H022 — "do it" classification; memory-index unlocked-writer race (init setup/migration now lock-guarded); writeJson per-pid temp + rename retry. |
| 21.113.1 | feat: Simple Communication style pinned in RULES (plain unpacking, 비유 금지, community banter). |
| 21.113.0 | feat: D113 harness diet phase 2 — injection compression (~55% per turn, ~63% RULES), pressure model-exposure + behavioral guards (pressure/sycophancy/scope) retired from wiring, 3-field response ending removed, Codex delegation execution-turn-only, investigating fan-out risk-based. |
| 21.112.0 | feat: D113 harness diet phase 1 — PreCompact bounded (I083 defect fix), doc token figures corrected to measured values, light-workflow retired (hotfix = single one-pass record; worklog read-side kept for in-flight W docs). |
| 21.111.1 | feat: humor clause `(e) write with a sense of humor` added to the `RULES` Simple Communication principle in `inject-rules.js`; injected on both hosts. |
| 21.111.0 | feat: Claude-host-only `## Codex Delegation` guidance block (`CODEX_DELEGATION`) appended after the shared first-turn context in `inject-rules.js`; Codex adapter path excluded by host gate; parity test updated. |
| 21.110.2 | fix: add a Promise fail-open boundary to every Codex hook launcher; enforce it in the native hook contract and directly regress missing-module and rejected-adapter failures on Windows. |
| 21.110.1 | fix: restore `봉인해제` / `UNLEASH` before the v21.107.0 intent mutation gate; lock and persist a complete zeroed pressure reset without weakening read-only ordinary questions; add real shared-`main()` regression coverage. |
| 21.110.0 | feat: goal-driven regressing continuation — regressing/discussing skills print a `/goal` handoff and require measurable Convergence Criteria (Claude Code 2.1.139+, Codex CLI 0.128.0+); v21.107.0 Stop-consolidation audit (all other wiring preserved, bounded continuation verified live); Hook Flow docs sync. |
| 21.109.0 | feat: non-git file backup rule — overwrite a single `<file>.bak` right before modifying; one backup per file, never accumulate (injected RULES + CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md regeneration). |
| 21.108.0 | feat: restore one shared mandatory intent/understanding/explanation response ending through both native prompt hooks; preserve natural response bodies, the internal task contract, all nine Codex events, and all Claude-specific lifecycle behavior. |
| 21.107.0 | feat: shared native Claude/Codex lifecycle semantics, nine-event Codex hooks, preserved Claude behavior, parent-evidence completion control, alternating-host memory/workflow recovery, portable mutation verifier, Windows/Linux clean-profile matrix, and seven-state live doctor. |
| 21.106.1 | docs: remove stale pre-Cycle-3 fixed-WA/verifier/count descriptions from current architecture sections and align the Claude/Codex hook boundary with v21.106.0 runtime behavior. |
| 21.106.0 | feat: D110 Cycle 3 — portable schema-v2 verification contracts and mutation failures; fixed-count/parent-write orchestration removal; 19-file verifier/count/role retirement after disabled baseline; memory and safety boundaries preserved. |
| 21.105.0 | feat: D110 Cycle 2 — parent-owned orchestration contract/defaults, five-stage light workflow, natural reporting, retired presentation audit, and live Codex A/B corpus with reference perturbation and false-done rejection. |
| 21.104.0 | feat: D110 Cycle 1 — Codex-native marketplace/install cache, explicit Codex-only PreToolUse adapter, shared path-policy core, live doctor/status, installed memory wrappers, and portable clean-profile behavioral regressions. |
| 21.103.0 | fix: W028 — `classifyAgent` description-only (prompt keywords caused WA→RA misclassification; false single-WA Stop block); remove light-workflow single-WA Stop block (rule absent from SKILL.md). Both defects v21.52.0 b4d3933. |
| 21.102.0 | feat: I079 R1 — replace 7-field response skeleton with 3-field caveman-terse version (`SKELETON_3FIELD`); removed 4 self-check fields; renamed [쉬운 설명]→[설명]; sync test files + behavior-verifier-prompt.md + manifest. User-approved. |
| 21.101.0 | fix: I078 Tier-1 source cleanup — restore dead "Unreflected from Last Session" SessionStart section (`load-memory.js` `entry.text`); `verification-sequence.js` now keeps a FAILED test from clearing the git-commit gate; fix `search-docs`/`lint`/`memory-autosave` SKILL doc drift; convert 5 redundant memory/status slash-commands to skill-delegating stubs (drop hardcoded cache path). Tests 52/52 files PASS. |
| 21.100.0 | feat: disable behavior-verifier (감시자) — removed Stop hook entry from hooks.json so the verifier sub-agent is never dispatched (Opus 4.8 model-upgrade audit: recorded verdicts caught only format-marker absences, zero substantive failures; it ran an Opus background agent per turn). Consumer code/script/prompt retained dormant; SKELETON_7FIELD format injection + all other guards unchanged. |
| 21.99.6 | fix: remove Edit→Grep cycle gate from verification-sequence — Gate 1 removed (incomplete detection, deadlock-prone); kept Gate 2 (commit without test); tests 30/30 PASS. |
| 21.99.5 | fix: restore UNDERSTANDING-FIRST gap definition — UNDERSTANDING-FIRST section + SKELETON_7FIELD [이해] field + CLAUDE.md + verifier prompt content rule; `Understanding = gap closed` definition restored from v21.9.0. |
| 21.99.4 | fix: I077/H018 behavior-verifier self-dispatch loop guard — narrow verifier-meta early-exit before pending state write; ordinary task notifications preserved; `_test-trigger-model.js` cases 8-10; full regression 52/52 + manifest 35/35 PASS. |
| 21.99.3 | fix: I076/W026 latest release risk cleanup — direct `node` hook launcher for all 26 hooks; hardened `find-node.sh` fallback; marketplace version sync; manifest shell-portability + stale-marker fixes; regression tests aligned with current 7-field verifier and D108 cleanup. |
| 21.99.2 | fix: 7-field skeleton 가독성 (H016 빈 줄 + 압축 지시, H017 [의도]/[이해]/[쉬운 설명] 하단 재배치). 사용자 transparency 회복. cycle1 inject test 6/6 PASS. |
| 21.99.1 | fix: D109 cycle 2 — `run-verify.js` `parseArgs()` `startsWith('-')` closes argv[2] single-dash flag capture bug; `verify-classify.js` assertion-fail regex extended with V012 (`^FAIL:\|\nFAIL:`) + V022 (`Command failed:.*\.exe.*_test-[\w.-]+\.js`); `unknown` ratio 40%→0%; manifest AC-6 `v==='21.99.1'`. |
| 21.99.0 | feat: D109 cycle 1 — failure classification renderer (`verify-classify.js`, grouped `run-verify.js` output, `[<failureClass>]` prefix in `verify-guard.js`, 15-case / 31-assertion unit test, 6 manifest entries). fix: runner `parseArgs()` + `RUNNER_RECURSION` nested full-manifest guard; AC-6 manifest sync to current version. |
| 21.98.1 | fix: H015 — Korean idle echo regex extension in `scripts/behavior-verifier.js` (`hasVerifierEcho` matches Korean dispatch echoes); `SKELETON_7FIELD` in `scripts/inject-rules.js` prepended with bottom-placement instruction. Closes infinite verifier-dispatch loop on Korean sessions and resolves skeleton/answer visual collision. |
| 21.98.0 | feat: W024 — `[완결 충동]` 7th skeleton field; `SKELETON_6FIELD`→`SKELETON_7FIELD` in inject-rules.js; `COMPRESSED_CHECKLIST` item 11 appended; verifier prompt §0.5 marker table + content-rule + pseudocode 6→7. |
| 21.97.0 | feat: Codex knowledge skill and K-page generation via `scripts/codex-docs.js knowledge`. |
| 21.96.2 | fix: H014 — `EMERGENCY_STOP_CONTEXT` Step 4 rewritten from "ask the user what went wrong" to "state the inferred gap declaratively." Removes deflection that compounded frustration the diagnostic reset was meant to defuse. |
| 21.96.1 | fix: H013 — verifier rubric path absolutized in `scripts/inject-rules.js:911` so dispatch resolves against the plugin install dir instead of `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. |
| 21.96.0 | fix: behavior-verifier workflow-active idle echo loop by skipping verifier/monitor wait echoes before pending-state write. |
| 21.95.0 | feat: Codex investigating skill and I-document generation via `scripts/codex-docs.js investigation` / `investigating`. |
| 21.94.0 | feat: `/crabshell:install-codex` manual bridge command and `scripts/install-codex.js` for linking a Claude-installed checkout into Codex marketplace and skill locations. |
